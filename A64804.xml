         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

As to his Military concerns, he made his Souldiers Commanders of the chiefeſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of War (that is) to be Faithful, Obedient, Reſolute to fight, loving to their Country, and loyal to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: So likwiſe in the private Exerciſes of his Troops, thoſe under his Command were as Ornaments in peace, and a guard in War: This only was not the heighth of his ambition, for he made it a principle to himſelf in Warlike combates, not to have many names, but many
<pb facs="tcp:42528:6"/> hands: And for his deportments, I am ſure none was more beloved in his Country, nor could command more able and ſtouter Souldiers for his Majeſties ſervice than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And I hope the Heavens have moſt largely rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for his blood ſpilt in his late Majeſties ſervice (of ever bleſſed memory.)</p>

There is in you ſtrength enough to ſhield a juſt cauſe; and a Royal cauſe is able to advance your power: give me leave to tell you there can be nothing done by you without it; it is that which giveth ſtrength and ſinewes, to all your motions.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:42528:7"/> all that time I never ſaw any thing of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, nor his latter piece as yet.</p>
                  <p>This you'l find to be but methodical collections for the young Country Souldier; and in our rural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes they can draw up but twelve files, in which I am ſtinted to a very ſmall number for ſo great a work; if there were a proportionableneſs in the Armes, the figures would have been better; yet not in the leaſt preſuming to teach you; but I hope with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtructions you will allow it uſeful for us in the Country, although your abilities may teach the world ten times more. I aim'd at nothing but to ſhew how neceſſary the readyneſs and uſe of Armes is, and of men to be well exerciſed in them. Which hath been a benefit to Republicks, as Hiſtory and experience hath made to appear; for what Nation hath not found ſafety in the expert uſe of them, and in the neglect thereof ruin?</p>
                  <p>I hope there are none of you ſo diſloyal, as not to obey your Princes Commands; in Order to which I cannot but Commend your cloſe order to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (and not to be at open diſtances); it is that which will make your obedience free, your affections ſettled, your ſelves renowned, and as I may in ſome part ſay, the peace of the Kingdom ſecured.</p>

                  <p>But leſt theſe few Collectives might meet with ſome objections, why that I ſhould treat of the Horſe in the firſt place, when Antiquity alloweth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency thereof to the Infantry; It was not to raiſe a diſpute amongſt the Noviſts, but I leave ſuch to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the precedencies in a Council of War, and who taking place there will reſolve them: And it is well known to moſt of you I was a Commander of Horſe my ſelf; and then having finiſhed my weak thoughts as to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof, which being viewed by ſome Gentlemen of our Country, I was deſired by them to ſet out likewiſe ſome few Collections for the young foot Souldier.</p>
                  <p>It is true there have been many Books printed of this Art in our paſt ages, and ſome in our preſent; and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of making many Books there is no end; yet if it had not been for Books this Art might have been buried in oblivion. And if I ſhould ſet out at full how all that we practiſe is not only borrowed from Antiquity, but moſt of the very words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand are kept ſtill in uſe, it would be too large, and it being not my buſineſs, I ſhall acquieſce with what I intended for my private uſe, but being (as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) requeſted hereunto,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>When</hi> London <hi>was burnt,</hi> 1666. Sept. 3d. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and now fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that moſt of our books are conſumed by fire, I am further perſwaded to put theſe introductives to publick view. Let me perſwade, you fellow Souldiers, although you meet with many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and ſcoffs in your Country, although taxes lie heavy upon you, and your allowances do not anſwer your moderate expences, nay although not your due for your time ſpent herein, yet go on; for I
<pb facs="tcp:42528:8"/> will boldly tell you that practical knowledge in this Art is the higheſt ſtep to preferment.</p>
                  <p>We read among the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and in our latter age of <hi>M. Spinola,</hi> who through maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgement and great Learning became Generals as ſoon as Souldiers: Intimating that it is the Prerogative of Princes to be born leaders of Armies; But others muſt expect to aſcend this Mountain of Honour by many and difficult ſtepps. Therefore firſt lay a foundation of honeſt fame, labouring after the practice of private vertues; Then orderly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſignalize thy ſelfe by ſome publique atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which I doubt not, but every generous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will endeavour the aſcention thereof) you may be aſſured that paſſing once the brunt of it, even to the hazzard of life it ſelf, you'l find delightful pleaſures in following the exerciſes of this <hi>Art Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who is it that ſhall think ſo deſpicably of a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or his profeſſion ſo baſe, as ſome have ſo accounted them? When they that are the ſons of <hi>Mars</hi> and have the true form of Military Diſcipline, are highly to be eſteemed as honourable, and as neceſſary members in a Kingdome; ſuch as no Kingdome can be without.</p>
                  <p>It is honourable, becauſe it is compaſſed about with ſuch reaſons as that the contemners thereof by the judicious are much reproved; for that State that is not able to ſtand it out in Armes againſt the rage of inteſtine, and forraign violence, is ſure to fall into the hands of the deſtroyer. How can any particular intereſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb facs="tcp:42528:9"/> it ſelf without it? I will boldly ſay that the Deſpiſers of the uſe of Armes, are not only diſloyal to their Prince but deſtructive to themſelves. What are the Laws and Civil Orders without defence for the maintenance of them? I may truly terme them like a Ship without a Rudder, which being let at liberty to every guſt of Wind will be ruined upon the Rocks of Rebellion: Or like ſome curious Edifice erected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a roof, which cannot withſtand the violence of any ſtorme. <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> by the perſwaſions of ſome peaceable Subjects caſhier'd his antient Legions, by which he overthrew the beſt of his Military Diſcipline, and ſo left an open gap for the barbarous Nations to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> in the time of Peace provided for War. What Nation dare to meddle with that People who are prepared, and well exerciſed in this Art of War?</p>
                  <p>Therefore let every one, Gentlemen and Farmours, Rich and poor, that intend to approve themſelves true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men and Loyal Subjects, not only imbrace, honour and cheriſh Armes, but alſo exerciſe (and be exerciſed) and diligently learn this Military Art: that in caſe any Rebellion or treachery may ariſe, they may be fit to defend His <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> perſon, with all his rights and Prerogatives: That ſuch as our late inteſtine ruines may be for ever hereafter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: That the Armed ſervant may no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the unarmed Maſter: Nor the Rebellious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Subject his unarmed Prince.</p>
                  <p>Let us not be overwhelmed in ſecurity, but when
<pb facs="tcp:42528:9"/> any ſuddain Alarme may ſound in our ears, there may be alwayes found ſuch ready and fit both to command and obey. <hi>Solomon</hi> doth in effect tell us, that it is not the great number of untrained men that are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for defence when he ſaith, <hi>A wiſe man is ever ſtrong;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible for any Kingdome or Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to live in peace, without the uſe of the Sword: As Idleneſs and the neglect of Warlike Diſcipline hath been the ruine of many States; ſo the Order of the antient <hi>Romans</hi> reſolved not to lie as ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, nor to delight in Idle, or wanton paſtimes, but at certain times allotted them in a year for the bettering of their experience in Warlike Exerciſes, they did it with delight and pleaſure, ſo that no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein was burdenſome to them: and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the practice thereof moſt ready and expert in the ſame, became at laſt, as Hiſtory hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, great and mighty Conquerours.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh the ſame of us, that our reputation may not ſcornfully be laid aſide, as if we minded more our Carpets, and the following products thereof, than the Musquett; That through the Exerciſe of this Military Art, we may become ſo mighty and Valiant, as that we may be able to withſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppoſition both Forraign and Domeſtick.</p>

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42528:11"/>1. <hi>In Reward:</hi> That Souldier that expects advancement from his Commander, muſt be ſo ſtout in his reſolutions, as perfectly to perform what is commanded: And when he ſhall anſwer his Commanders expectation, in the execution of ſome ſingular ſervice, he ought to receive <hi>Fame, Honour</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> as a reward for it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, That Souldier whoſe care is, that at all times his behaviour be ſuch as to endeavour after all vertuous habits, and being ſo adorned, he ought to have that which vertuous Souldiers moſt deſire and labour after; That is <hi>Good Fame:</hi> for it is the food of his reputation, and nouriſheth towards Honour in the higheſt Atchievements.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond reward; and that is <hi>Honour:</hi> It is not the nature of a true Souldier to hunt after Honour, or to buy it with Bribes; It is blood and not gold, that hath been the price of Honour: Therefore that Souldier that ſhall thus deſerve, ought not to be voyded of it, but according to his merits and quality, ought to have his preferment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly; but not the leaſt, the good, ſaithful, and ſtout Souldiers reward is <hi>Wealth;</hi> that when they are preferred they may not be deſpiſed, but to be in ability, as to the greatneſs and ſmallneſs of place, to hold up to his Rank and advancement; without Theſe a Souldier can neither perform nor continue the duty of his calling;<note place="margin">M. D. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>27.</hi>
                        </note> and therefore the beſtowing thereof deſerveth great conſideration, that the well deſerving Souldier at no time ſhould be neglected.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be acknowledged that <hi>Rewards</hi> are ſeldome ſeen, for Offices are more often known to be beſtowed for favour (if not for money) than for deſert: What makes many brave ſpirits to give up their ſervices; but when they ſee their way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement cut off, and their pay it may be hard to come by; in regard that ſome Pay-Maſters, or Treaſurers have been corrupt, that the ſouldier ſhall not have his pay without ſome unknown fees? And rather than to commit any baſe action in his Country, he is forced to deſert the ſervice; or when their ſervice is ended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they'l give one part of their juſt dues, that they may have the other, they ſhall be delayed. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is one reaſon there are ſo many unwilling hearts to ſerve their Country; and what makes a Souldier ſo deſpicable in his Country, as to be forced to uſe extremity even for neceſſity ſake? How baſe a thing is it for ſome Deputy Chieftains that make it their ſtudy to rob Honours Workmen of their hire? And if it be ſo in our Country affairs, and in times of Peace; What can be expected from ſuch in times of trouble? Let ſuch know that Honours trumpet ſhall never ſound their prayſes.</p>
                     <p>But to ſuch as ſhall not in the leaſt debar it from the deſerved, but (as I may terme it) are rather willing to disburthen themſelves of their Souldiers ſtipend; to ſuch, I ſay, not only remains the obſequious diligence of their Souldiers to ſerve them in all hazzardous attempts; but alſo the glorious title of a faithful Steward, which draws after it both the affection of Prince and People.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There are alſo <hi>Puniſhments</hi> due to thoſe that are Vicious and Cowardly; for nothing more holds a Souldier in his due obedience than the ſeverity of Diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>Souldiers (as <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith) ought to ſtand more in awe of their Generals, than in fear of their Enemies: Diſcipline being once infringed, either by a ſlightment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or neglect of a Souldiers juſt pay, will cauſe the Vertuous to deſiſt, and to others 'twill prove a ſpur, to neceſſitate them to baſe Actions; which with other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, when ſeen by ſuperiour Officers, and ſhall not according to Martial Law endeavour to puniſh ſuch vicious Actions; I ſay the Souldier inſtead of ſubmitting to the Commands of his Leader, oftentimes breaketh forth into Mutinies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions. I muſt confeſs when, and where <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> are not ſlighted, the wellfare of a Country will be ſo ſupported, that no Vice ſhall be able to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it: So in an Army, what maketh a Souldier to forget obedience, more than the want of Pay and the execution of good Laws? which being duly performed, the Souldier will undoubtedly, the better know his Duty and Diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>Here, by the way, I cannot but infert ſome few things that are prejudicial to the Souldier, and Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, When the Publique Service of God is ſo neglected, that the whole Souldery, under a Chriſtian Prince are not tyed to be Exerciſed in the ſame Religion his Prince is of; for Faction amongſt them will do more hurt, than bullets againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When high debauchery is not ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When Gaming is not moſt ſtrictly forbidden; becauſe it is not only a waſte of Maintenance, and an Introduction to Quarrels, but a Prophanation of God's holy name.</p>
                     <p>And Fourthly, When Muſter-maſters are ſo careleſs in their Office, as to ſuffer any Captain, upon wilful abſence of Souldiers, to receive ſome out of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, or hired men out of the Town and Country; this being well conſidered will prove prejudicial both to King and Country.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, When thoſe ſtrict Laws againſt Duelling are not better obſerved, that for every trivial quarrel, the life of a ſtout ſpirited Gentleman muſt drop.<note place="margin">

                     <p>IT is not my intention to run through the deſcription of every particular Officer at large, of his duty in his reſpective place; it being ſet forth at large in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authours: I ſhall therefore briefly paſs them over; hoping it will be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of all that undertake any Office Military, in the ſervice of his King and Country, to labour after a true form of Diſcipline, that is now in exerciſe by Authority in general; That when it ſhall pleaſe our Gracious King to call for us, we may not be uncapable of Command: What greater diſhonour can there be than for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to be commanded by his inferiour Officers? Therefore it behoves all in their ſeveral Capacities, who are willing to win Honour; not to be wanting in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after the Exerciſe of Arms.</p>

                        <p>None were admitted Souldiers among the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ſuch as were of an honeſt Tribe, (or Family, as being more likely to labour after Victory, not only for his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but for his goods, or eſtate.) As for thoſe that were abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, they might have liberty promiſed by their Enemies, and ſo betray their Truſt. Again, they would never take any Souldiers into their Armies, but ſuch as were well exerciſed before-hand; and this did their work, and obtained them Victories againſt their Enemies, <hi>Vegetius, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. The private Souldiers duty is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. Whenſoever he is commanded for ſervice, let him labour to be ſober, and patient, enduring all hardſhips and travels; To know and obſerve all Orders Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,<note place="margin">Liv.</note> Compleatly Armed, and expert in the uſe thereof; <hi>Horridum mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſſe decet, non caelato auro argentóque, ſed ferro.</hi> It becometh a Souldier beſt to appear terrible; not to be garniſhed with gold and ſilver, but with ſteel. And Souldiers ought not only to be obedient to their Captains; but chiefly to Love God, and Honour their King. This being the duty of a Souldier in general, there are two particular duties belonging to him, that is, as a <hi>Sentinel</hi> and a <hi>Scout.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Sentinels;</hi> The further any Sentinels are ſet from the body of the Guard, it is thought neceſſary two ſhould be placed, and there they are to endeavour both to hear and ſee, thereby to learn of their Enemy, what may be intended, and what they have diſcovered; that whilſt one goeth to certifie the Captain of the Guard, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42528:12"/> other may ſtand fixt, and obſerve what elſe might happen in his fellows abſence. A Sentinel muſt not alight from his Horſe unleſs it be for natural neceſſity, and but one of them at once. Near to the Body of the Guard there may be placed but a ſingle Sentinel, to obſerve the moving of the double. If the diſtances be not too large, if there be any other Croſs-ways or advenues, that each Sentinel may ſee the other, then there may be but a ſingle ſet; for they muſt know that they are ſet there only to certifie the Body of the Guard concerning the ſeveral occurrances that may happen: Suppoſe a Sentinel ſhould be provoked by any advantagious affairs; It is reſolved he muſt not ſtir a foot; for that Sentinel that ſhall by day or night, remove from the place where he was ſet by his Corporal, before he ſhall be by him fetched off (or relieved) ſhall he puniſhed with death.<note place="margin">Polyb. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                           <hi>and to change them, conducting them to his Guard; (but the Cornet is not to forſake his Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;) Then the Captain of the Guard is to go the firſt Round, to ſee not only that all things are ſafe, but alſo whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Scouts;</hi> They are not only to diſcover the High-wayes, but alſo to ſcoure them: they are to be of a number, anſwerable to the danger of the Guard; for the hazzard of them, may prove dangerous, both to a private Guard or an Army in General. They are to give notice of the Enemies motion, of his approach, and of the number of them, that all ſuddain ſurprizes may be prevented.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>A Provoſt Martial;</hi> For the badge of his Office he is to have in his hand a ſtaffe or Truncheon; and having the ſame in his hand, it is death for any Souldier vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to lay hands on him: All Delinquents are to be delivered to him, by the Chief in Command. He is not to enter any quarter without the leave of the Chief Officer for any Priſoner; He is to clear all by-ways of Souldiers, that no prejudice may be done by them in their March; He is to ſee all Orders publiſhed, be duly executed; He muſt be an honeſt man, and take no Bribes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>A Trumpeter,</hi> ought to be a man skilful in all the ſounds of the Trumpet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; He ought to deliver all Embaſſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ought to obſerve the Enemies Works, Guards, and Souldiers, that he may give a good accompt thereof at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: And for the better performance thereof, he ought to be a man witty and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and to manage it diſcreetly; He ought not in the leaſt to diſcover any thing, as may prejudice his own party; He muſt not fail to ſound the hours commanded: One Trumpet is to be with the Cornet, and he is to be allowed by the Captain for him; who is to receive a liſt of the Guards from the Cornet, and is privately to warn the Souldiers thereof.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Corporals,</hi> in a Troop of Horſe, have been always allowed to be of great uſe; who ought to be of a civil carriage and ſtout ſpirit; they are to be three or more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the allowance of Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are to be aſſiſtant to the Lieutenant in placing of the Sentinels, each in their ſeveral ſquadrons when they are to perform duty: If any parties are to be ſent abroad, either for diſcovery, or to ſcoure the high-wayes, a Corporal is to be ſent with them; He is bound to keep a liſt of his Squadron.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>A Quarter-Maſter,</hi> ought to be a man of much fidelity in regard of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Billets;</hi> He is to have the Command of the Troop in the abſence of his ſuperiour Officers: Who in going to make his Billets is to have a Souldier along with him by the appointment of the Lieutenant, who is to return to the Troop to conduct them to their Quarters.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>A Cornet,</hi> ought to be a man of gallant behaviour and undaunted courage; His place in the Troop upon a march is on the front of his own ſquadron; and to take the Standard himſelf, marching through any great Town or City (or when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) or into the field with it flying; and when any General ſhall appear in the field he is to drop the head of his ſtandard towards the ground in obeyſance to him. His
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42528:13"/> Place when the Troop is drawn up (to the opinion of ſome) is for to exerciſe upon the left of the Captain, ſomewhat behind the Captain; But in fight or skirmiſh, he is to place himſelf in the firſt rank of his own ſquadron; with his ſtaffe ſunkt or ſlopt; and in danger, it is more honour to break his Launce (or ſtaff) himſelf, then to ſuffer his ſtandard to be broken and taken from him: He is to keep a liſt of the Troop, and wait every day upon his Superiour Officers; and ſuch Souldiers as his Captain and Lieutenant ſhall appoint he ſhall ſend to the Guard: In the abſence of the Captain and Lieutenant he is to command the Troop.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>For the Lieutenant;</hi> The Reer is aſſigned him for his place, and was antiently called <hi>Tregidux,</hi> that is a Reer Commander: And Lieutenant is a <hi>French</hi> word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying one which ſupplyeth the place of another; for in the abſence of the Captain he commands the Troop; appointing an Officer to be in the Reer: He ought to be a man well educated in Cavalry, and in the other parts of the Art Military. He ought to be ſtrict to ſee the ſouldiers punctually to do their ſervice, and to have a care to their Horſes and Arms in the field and fight. He being in the Reer is not only to encourage the Souldiers, but to have his ſword drawn, and to kill any that ſhall endeavour to flee, and not to fight. He ought to know the ability of his Souldiers, keeping the liſt of their names; that the Guards may be in a readineſs, with the Captains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and by him delivered to the Cornet.</p>
                        <p>In the mounting of the Guard, he is to inform himſelf of the place for the Guard, and of the Sentinels for to ſet, the ways for to be ſcoured, and muſt go himſelf with the Corporal of the Guard, and ſee the firſt Sentinels placed; And when he hath the Guard himſelf, he muſt often viſit them; always to be armed and to keep his bridle day and night upon his horſe's head.</p>
                        <p>When the Troop is drawn up to lodge the Standard; He is to ſee the Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter deliver to the Souldiers their reſpective Billets for their quartering, upon that Alt before they move, for then the Souldier will know thereby the better where to wait on the Cornet upon any occaſion.</p>
                        <p>He ought to viſit all Quarters, as to his liſt received, and ſee that the Souldiers be of civil bevaviour; and if any complaints be made of any diſorder, he is to remedy it, by puniſhing the Offenders.</p>
                        <p>When the Trumpet ſounds to Horſe, he ought to be firſt mounted, and to cauſe all immediately to do the ſame; He muſt puniſh all lingring and lazie Souldiers that are not preſently mounted with him. The good Examples of a Leader have ever been obſerved to be of a marvellous efficacy with the Souldiers.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Every Captain</hi> ought to be obedient, valiant, and reſolute in the execution of all Commands with Judgement, diſcretion and Valour; that with vertuous nobleneſs and generoſity he may win the love of his Souldiers, to their King, Country, and himſelf; and that by his own experience in the knowledge of Military Diſcipline, he may be able to govern his Souldiers accordingly.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Colonels,</hi> They ought to have an high reſpect with all Obedience to their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Officers, faithfully to perform their Commands, and that with care, valour, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and diligence they govern their Regiments.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. <hi>And when every General</hi> ſhall make his whole Army to love and fear God, and ſhall govern with prudence, care, order and Juſtice; and knowing how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, remedy and execute, as occaſions ſhall offer themſelves, with great skill and dexterity, will make himſelf no leſs loved than feared.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From</hi> theſe Officers, the Trained Bands of this Kingdom (with the Ships) are the defence thereof (or ought to be;) but to ſpeak of the choice of the Souldiers, or of their being armed, or well diſciplined, (as in many places is much neglected,) and where the fault is, as I am an inferiour Officer I muſt be ſilent: Pardon me to ſay it would be much better if his Majeſties Deputies would caſt their eyes and commands oftner amongſt them.</p>
                        <p>I could wiſh that our <hi>Militia</hi> inſtead of celebrating their Feaſts to <hi>Mars,</hi> did it not too much to <hi>Bacchus</hi> with carouſing and drunkenneſs; which folly and deteſtable vice is an Enemy to all Vertues, both of ſoul and body; (and to all Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42528:13"/> It is the very Nurſe of Effeminacy, of Cowardiſe, of Senſuality, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and of all other Vices that can be imagined.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Curaſiers,</hi> who were both for Horſe and Armes in no wiſe inferiour to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers (his Lance excepted) and are alſo offenſive but chiefely defenſive; but not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thoſe inconveniences as the former with their Lances: He is to have under his Armour (which is <hi>Capa pe</hi>) a good Buff coat, and good Peternels with a Sword whoſe point muſt be ſtiff, and ſharp, his Sadle and bitt ſtrong, and his bridle with an Iron chain to prevent cutting: he is to have a boy to carry his armes, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for him. Theſe are the heavy-armed for the Horſe ſervice which are not uſed amongſt us, eſpecially in our ſettled Militia, nor but few of the next, which are termed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Harnuebuziers,</hi> who are very ſerviceable and are to be armed defenſive with a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42528:14"/> good Buff coat, and to have a back, breaſt and pot, Piſtoll proofe: and for his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armes, he is to have a good Harquebuz, hanging on a Belt, with a ſwivel, and ſerviceable Piſtols, as is ſet forth in the Horſe ſervice by Act of Parliament for the ſervice of the Militia, but rather ſomewhat larger, and a good cutting ſword; His Horſe ſhould be ſomewhat better than the Militia Horſes, as is ſet forth in the ſaid Statute, with a ſtrong Sadle, and bitt; and his bridle to be made with a chain that the cutting thereof may be prevented.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Carabiniers</hi> are to be armed defenſive as the Harquebuziers, their Horſes may be ſomwhat leſſer, but for the offenſive Armes inſtead of the Harquebuz, a good Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, hanging on a belt with a ſwivel, by the ring of the Carabine; but for Piſtols and Swords, they muſt be according to the Act of Parliament for the Arming of a Militia Trooper, as in the ſaid Act more at large appeareth.</p>
                     <p>The ſervice of them in execution is not to be diſputed; the Experienced Souldier can teſtifie enough of the ſingular benefit they are of in ſervice; although it is not regarded in ſome places in the Country, I believe it is not their Judgements, but rather their unwillingneſs to put themſelves (the rich men of the Country) to ſuch a charge, and not to walk one ſtep further than the bare words of the Act of Parliament will impower them.</p>
                     <p>I hope when his Grace the Duke of <hi>Somerſett</hi> ſhall appear in the head of the Militia of the County of <hi>Somerſett</hi> all defaults of Men, Horſes and Armes will then be moſt regularly amended: And then the Souldrie in general and the Horſe in particular, being made compleat Carabiniers, the men and horſes to be one and the ſame, kept, preſerved, managed, and made fit for ſervice, his Majeſty may the better truſt to his Militia, who may be alſo capable of doing him and their Country ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Wounds are never feared by them, who are well horſed, well armed, and well exerciſed. I crave pardon of the Ingenious Reader if I digreſſively propound a queſtion or two, and I wiſh the guilty would anſwer them by their good examples in better perfomances hereafter.</p>
                     <p>How many of thoſe Gentlemen that ſhould find Horſes for his Majeſty in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Militia, will ſend no other, but ſuch as are common for all uſes? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of keeping them in their ſtables, well meating, and managing of them fit for ſervice, they'l ſend them long journies, ſet them to plough, or other carriages and draughts, not regarding how ſuddainly they may be called for ſervice.</p>
                     <p>How many ſend in their Armes reſtie and unfixed, not fit for ſervice? ſome have ſent baſe pads, ordinary hackney ſadles; others for covetouſneſs have ſent their ſervants with ſnafle bridles; How many are there that borrow Horſes and Armes one of another?</p>
                     <p>And I am truly ſorry to ſee ſome ſufficient Gentlemen that have taken ſo much paines to ride for to eaſe themſelves, or to be freed from reaſonable aſſeſſments upon them. I wiſh ſome could clear themſelves that command us, whoſe Horſes ought to be the firſt that ſhould apear, and beſt equipt, from being the worſt and laſt, nay not at all to ſome Muſters; for this the Country murmurs at: And how can our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of defaults be executed againſt the Criminal, when Juſtice it ſelf is guilty of the ſame errors? It is the good examples of our Superiours, that ſhould make the Inferiour tremble to do amiſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could wiſh that all neglects for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of His Majeſties Militia might be amended hereafter, according as Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath commanded; and for ſuch as muſt be ſubject thereunto, they would moſt willingly be obedient, and to cloſe with their Commanders in any thing that may advance the publique ſervice, and not to be ſtupidly ſecure, and baſely to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the uſe of Armes: Let ſuch know that I doe boldly affirme it for a truth to be a ſymptom of diſobedience and diſloyalty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The Dragonier.</hi> Dragoones are but Foot, (to be) on horſeback and are ſo mounted for the expedition of their march, who are to have large leather belts, for the more eaſie carriage of their Pikes and Muſquets, in ſome extraordinary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for making good of paſſes, linening of hedges, and other ambuſhments: But if you raiſe any Regiments of Dragoons, and ſo are to march, and to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42528:14"/> for the like expedition; their Muſquets are to be ſomewhat wider in the bore than the Field Muſquet, and about two foot and nine inches in length, and Pikes (if allowed) not to be above thirteen foot in length; his Horſe muſt be of a good met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and nimble, but of a leſs price and ſtature.</p>
                     <p>And in the execution of any ſervice (when commanded) they are to alight, and to every ten ſouldiers there is one to be allowed to hold their Horſes. Some have been of an opinion that he is of ſuch excellent ſervice as that the duty of the Carabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier may be wholy laid aſide; whoſe arguments have been judged frivolous by the judicious in this Art, that I need not trouble you any more with them, but do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Muſquetiers on horsback to be made Dragooners upon ſome ſpecial ſervice; or that the Dragooner himſelf may be very uſefull for expedition and incloſed Countries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>I have treated of the Souldier, and of arming of him. I humbly inſert; Seeing the whole burden lyeth upon the Loyall hearted ſubject, and the diſcontented par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſit ſtill, grow rich and laugh at it, therefore it hath been the opinion of ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that the diſcontented party ſhould be armed in the Trained Bands, and made to performe and execute all commands whatever. I am of an other opinion, but ſhall not preſume a determination in this place.</p>

                     <p>THe Horſe being in a body to exerciſe, and to make the Souldier more able to handle his armes, when he ſhall be called forth to fight; The words of Command ſhall follow.</p>

                     <p>Although Mounting to Horſe is no Poſture of Arms, and but a preparative to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Service, I ſhall preſuppoſe the Souldiers to be diſmounted, annd ſtand ready by their Horſes in a body; The word of Command (according to our Engliſh mode is) <hi>To horſe.</hi>

                     <p>Now all being ready to Mount muſt be careful that his Horſe be well girt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as a preparative to Exerciſe there is another word of Command <hi>[Silence]</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out there be ſilence in the body, the Souldier in no wiſe can diſtinctly hear, what is commanded by the chief Officer; It is the Souldiers Ear, and care to preſerve the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from fractions, and where Silence is not diligently performed, the Souldier doth not only fail in his motions, but the event will be naught, for it is the very footſtep to raſhneſs; And it is as <hi>Livius</hi> ſaith <hi>(Temeritas praeterquam quòd ſtulta eſt etiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foelix)</hi> not only fooliſhneſs, but infortunate.</p>

                        <p>The Souldier having fired and returned his Piſtol, (if time will permit him ſo to do) he is to take himſelf to the uſe of the ſword, (his ſword being drawn and placed in his bridle hand, near to the hilt of the ſword) and having received it into his weapon hand for ſervice, muſt place the pummel upon his right thigh, and ſo to raiſe his point to his mark, higher or lower, as occaſion ſerveth, and therewith to endeavour to diſable his Enemy, either by cutting his Horſes bridle, or other his Arms, that he ſerveth in, which if diſcreetly managed will prove perilous to them.</p>
                        <p>And further, it is very requiſite that the <hi>Harquebuzier</hi> and <hi>Carabinier</hi> be often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to ſhoot bullets at a mark, that in time they may be approved marks-men: In order to which they are to take ſpecial care not to over-charge their peeces with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as it is too much an errour in many, endeavouring more for a report, than for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;) Wherefore there ought not to be in proportion for any peece, but almoſt half as much the weight in Powder, of the bullet; or, the Diameter and half of the peece is charge enough: And it ought to be the ſpecial care of every Commander to ſee that his Souldiers be ſerved with good powder and well caſt bullets; and that their bullets be directly fit to their Carabines and Piſtols.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould now come to ſhew you what is to be learned by a Souldier, for the better demeaning of himſelf being joyned in a body. But ſhall not in this place ſhew at large what is meant by a File, or Rank; half files or half ranks; front,<note place="margin">Read in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the foot, <hi>pag.</hi>
                           </note> flanks, or reer; becauſe it will ſpend too much time, and our late unhappy differences have given ſome light thereunto: beſides there is ſo much writ of them in ſeveral Treatiſes of the Infantry, that it would be too much trouble here to treat thereupon.</p>

                        <hi>After</hi> that theſe firings have been performed and the Souldier is grown expert in the handling of his Arms, and well managing of his Horſe; there is one thing that ought not to be forgot by any Commander, which is of moſt excellent uſe; That is, for the Souldier to be well exerciſed, both with his Carabine and Piſtol to ſhoote with Bullet at Marks; which if it be not well exerciſed and taught, it will be to little purpoſe as to the Executive part of this Art.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So</hi> it ought to be the care of every Chief Officer to exerciſe thoſe Troops under his Command, ſometimes, as occaſion may ſerve, in a Regimental way; leaving ſufficient diſtances betwen each Troop, that each other may be relieved orderly; and ſo to retreat in due order, to avoid Confuſion.</p>

                     <p>BEfore I conclude theſe few ſpent hours about the Exerciſe of the Horſe, and that my demonſtrating of them but three in depth; I hear many brave Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (but old ones) to make ſome objections againſt me. As firſt, in medl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that which is of too high a concern for me.</p>
                     <p>My anſwer to that is breifly; That thoſe that have writ Books of this Art, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have been gallant Souldiers if they had been in Command now, and of late years to have ſeen what have been performed in the Executive part of the Horſe ſervice, they would correct their Judgements, and amend their Mode of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42528:22"/> finding in it much error, and ſerviceable for nought, but to prolong Execution; as if all experienced <hi>genus</hi>'s in this Art ſhould be tyed up to the <hi>Low Country</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: And what I have done is but my duty if accepted, elſe for my own private uſe, alſo for my friends and relations that come after me; And becauſe there ought to be a great deal of care had in a work of this nature, I leave the correction hereof to the better Learned and more Experienced in this Military Art.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> for the drawing of the Horſe but three in File; I ſay, If the <hi>Grecian</hi> Writers were alive, and ſome of our Modern Writers that have Commented upon them and made Collectives out of them, which they have publiſhed for authentick Maximes in this Art, would now much admire to ſee our Mode of Exerciſe ſo changed for the better.</p>

                        <hi>When</hi> as our late <hi>Cruſo</hi> in his Military inſtructions in his platformes of Exerciſe demonſtrates then Eight in depth, and Eight in rank: <hi>And</hi> Captain <hi>Ward</hi> in his Drilling and exerciſe of Horſe is ſix in File and twenty in Rank,<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Now</hi> if they had the uſe of Guns ſo much as we, and ſhould fire in Ranks, five, ſix, eight or ten in depth (and our mode of fighting being but three in File) their exerciſe would be ſo long in the performance thereof, that it would not only be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious but hazzardous to us; for of late years it hath been experienced, and ſeldome known any Troops to ſtand it out, as may be thought that time, in competition for victory: for we know that the ordering of our Horſe, in making a large Front, as occaſion and ground will give leave, and thereby over-winging our Enemies <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> hath proved Victorious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> whereas they alleadge when they are ſix and eight in File, they can make their body to ſhew powerful againſt their Enemy by commanding them to double their Fronts by their Middle-men (or half-file-leaders) and can if occaſion ſerve take away a party in the reer, and file the Enemy in their Flank, or Flanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be dangerous and of ill conſequence: for when we are ſettled in <hi>Battalia</hi> three deep, we are then fixed for ſervice, and need not be troubled in doubling of the Front, thereby we are free from diſtraction, and other diſturbances which are moſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by ſuddain motions to the breaking of Ranks and the like, which contrarywiſe is with us; for our fighting is not by wheeling off as formerly, but by charging at Piſtols length, and ſo to charge through; every man betaking himſelf to his Sword; or otherwiſe as occaſion ſhall ſerve: For when we aſſault our Enemy with our Carabines, and if time will permit it with one Piſtol, what need have we of ſuch tedious firing by Files or by Ranks,<note place="margin">I ſhewed thoſe firings only for exerciſe ſake.</note> which the experienced Souldier thinks uſeleſs; for when our Horſe are in a readineſs for execution, they muſt fire intire, which I conceive to be moſt offenſive: except the Enemy retreates, and wheels off, there will be but little uſe of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Piſtol.</p>

                        <hi>Thoſe</hi> Gentlemen are to be commended that will beſtow time in reading of this Art, but eſpecially ſuch as put in practice what they read; which is the readieſt way to make men fit for the ſervice of their King and Country: For what maketh a man more confidently Couragious, than knowledge?</p>

                        <hi>There</hi> are many Gentlemen that are greater Readers of the Wars, than Practitioners of the ſame; who have had ſome cavelling diſputes, about the diſcipline thereof; not conſidering the great change that time hath made, and experience hath found out in Martial affaires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the reading of the Roman and Grecian Orders, Diſcipline, and Government of their Armies, I had thought to have given you a taſt thereof, but deſerving a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pen than mine to ſet forth the Gallantry of them, I ſhall be ſilent: And yet if it were poſſible to renew them, it would never work the like effect, as it did againſt their Enemies; One great cauſe thereof is ſuppoſed, that they made better pay-men in thoſe dayes; Vice was ſeverely puniſhed, Vertue moſt bountifully rewarded: and when the Wars were ended, ſuch as deſerved well, were both regarded and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; or elſe remained inrolled in penſionary pay; ſo by that meanes the Exerciſe of Armes continued. It is to be obſerved that where Payment and Reward ceaſe, there Diſcipline and good Order ceaſeth alſo.</p>

                        <hi>As</hi> for the Exerciſe of Armes belonging to the Infantry, it is the part of the young Souldier to learn and practiſe, in the firſt place, the <hi>Poſtures,</hi> and well handling of Armes: Which I may term to be the ſingle Accidence of this Art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enters his Syntaxis: and it muſt be done by endeavouring to ſet ſome time apart for the exerciſe thereof.</p>

                        <hi>There</hi> have been many that have not only diſputed, but have writ againſt the many <hi>Poſtures</hi> now uſed; but being ſhamefully confuted by our Moderne Writers I ſhall be ſilent; and proceede to thoſe <hi>Poſtures</hi> belonging to ſuch Armes that are now in uſe in the Country, which are far ſhort of what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Exerciſe in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and therein of thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Societies of the Artillery and Military Gardens, and alſo now of late <hi>(The Criple)</hi> with out <hi>Criplegate.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>BEfore</hi> I give you the poſtures of them both, I ſhall give you a brief definition of a <hi>Poſture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Poſture <hi>is a mode or Garb that we are fixed unto, in the well handling of our Armes: In which there are motions attendant unto the ſame for the better grace.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preſuppoſing</hi> your company to be in the Field and drawn up in a ready way for Exerciſe, then the beſt way, is to Exerciſe them apart, by drawing of the body of Pikes from their Muſquets; that each may be Exerciſed in their particular <hi>Poſtures</hi> by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Only</hi> there are ſome Poſtures of the Pike and Muſquet which are anſwerable to each other by conformity; which ought to be performed in a Body, or upon a March, as occaſion ſerveth: as for Example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> Marching, All are to be ſhouldred; In Trooping, or in any other Motion, the Pikes are to be advanced, and the Muſquets poyſed: In Porting of the Pike, the Muſquet to be reſted; In Trailing of the Pike, the Muſquet to be reverſed; which is the Funeral Poſture: When the Pike is Cheek'd, the Muſquet is to be reſted at the Sentinel Poſture; when the Muſquet is preſented to fire, the Pike is to be charged; And when the Pike is Ordered, moſt commonly; (eſpecially in a ſtand or for Exerciſe) the butt end of the Muſquet is to be ſet to the Ground <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>So you are ready for a March; or in the Poſture upon the firſt motion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which is called the Saluting Poſture,</hi> is to be performed from the reſting (or palming) of the Muſquet; when he ſhall have an occaſion: as a Souldier to ſalute his Friend, or to the honouring of any other perſon deſerving.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Sentinel Poſture,</hi> is for the Muſquet to be in the Palm of the left hand, at his Reſting poſture: But his Muſquet to be charged with Powder and Bullet, his Cock freed, and to be ſecured with his Thumb, ſo to be ready to execute his charge, and commands given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Thus I have finiſhed the Poſtures of the Muſquet or Caliver with a Snap-hance, and with a Match-lock without a Reſt; for your further inquiry, if there need be, I refer you to Lieutenant <hi>Barriffe</hi> or Captain <hi>Ward.</hi>

                        <hi>Thoſe</hi> Souldiers that are thus Armed are the beſt to be commanded out upon any Party, becauſe they are the beſt able to defend themſelves and offend their Enemies: And when any hedges are to be lin'd with ſhot,<note place="margin">Weſt Country.</note> that the Muſquetteers by their forced ſervice become ſilent, and the ways deep and narrow; then the Half-Pike will be of ſingular ſervice.</p>

Hiſtory is full of the great ſlaughters and Atchievements in thoſe days, when the Bow was moſt in uſe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is laid aſide I ſhall be ſilent, hoping the practice will never be forgotten.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>IN</hi> this Military Age, who would have thought that few or any could be ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the difference between a File and a Rank; but finding in our Annual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes many (Farmor like) Souldiers to be much guilty thereof, I ſhall ſpeak a a little thereunto; ſhewing what is required to the making up of a File, and alſo of a Rank, with the dignity of each as they ſtand both in File and Rank.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A File.</note>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Know that a File is a ſequent Number of men, ſtanding one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind an other Front to the Reer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Or</hi> from the firſt which is termed a File-Leader, unto the laſt which is termed a bringer up, which ſhall be demonſtrated according to our mode of Diſcipline.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Rank is a Row of men be they more or leſs, ſtanding or marching, ſhoulder to ſhoulder in a direct Line from the right hand to the left, (and from the left to the right) even a breaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> by the way obſerve that in all preparations to exerciſe, Files muſt be made up firſt, and being then drawn forth, and the Files joyned together, Ranks are made.</p>

                        <hi>Both</hi> which are according to <hi>Barriffe, Ward,</hi> and others; but in giving their Dignities to a file of eight deep there are various opinions, yet all endeavouring after a Geometrical proportion; and it is that which Commanders ſhould chiefly follow as near as poſſibly they can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> becauſe the Sages of our Times do differ in their Judgments, more in this particular than in any one thing that I know of; I ſhall ſet down what Rules I have know or heard, leaving it to the more experienced that can command better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here</hi> followeth the Rule of <hi>Barriffe, Ward,</hi> and others in placing the Dignities, for ſix, eight, and ten, both in File and Rank.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall here inſert thoſe various Opinions of the Dignities of Souldiers eight in File, and ſo for eight Companies in a Regiment; by all which you may dignifie each Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in his due place of Honour; either in March, or in a Body: The conſideration that there is, or ought to be an anſwerableneſs in the Reer to the Front, in the left flank to the right, by an equitable right in their true Dignity, is that which giveth life and being to orderly Diſcipline; for the worth of one muſt be anſwerable to the other in Skill, Valour, and in Number.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> equality in this oppoſition is thus; As (1) and (4) makes five in the Colonels Diviſion, ſo (3) and (2) in the Lieutenant Colonels Diviſion makes five alſo: Then as in the firſt (5) and (8) makes thirteen; ſo the ſecond (7) and (6) is thirteen, which is an equal oppoſition.</p>

                        <note place="margin">As inform'd Mr. <hi>Elton</hi>'s Rule.</note>
                        <hi>A Second</hi> Opinion for the Dignity of eight Companies, is as followeth.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>ranks and files</figDesc>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe</hi> oppoſe as the firſt, and ſomewhat more in the equality of their Number; as one and ſix is ſeven in the right Wing of the Colonels Diviſion, ſo two and five is equal to that in the right Wing of the Lieutenant Colonels Diviſion; and ſix and ſeven is equally thirteen, in the firſt, as five and eight in the ſecond.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42528:31"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> according to the Rules for the Dignity of a File, the ſecond Captain hath loſt his place of Honour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For</hi> thoſe of that Opinion who place the ſecond Captain in the Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Diviſion, affirm that there may be a Geometrical equality (in length and breadth) in File and Rank; yet in point of Honour according to firſt Rule in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Diviſion, the ſecond Captain being placed loſeth his Dignity; for if the eldeſt Captain in priority is placed upon the Head or firſt Diviſion, Body or ſtand of Pikes, leading the Colonels Colours, then by the ſelf ſame Rule of Equity, the ſecond Captain <hi>Numb.</hi> (5) may and ought to be in the head of the Lieutenant Colonels Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Body or ſtand of Pikes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> which I conclude that the ſecond Captain hath as much Honour to bring up the Reer of the Colonels own Diviſion of Pikes when ſo marched; but if marched (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire) Regimentally, there to bring up the Reer of the whole Body or ſtand of Pikes is a greater Honour, and the ſecond Captains Dignity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A third</hi> Opinion for the Dignity of eight Companies.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>ranks and files</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> is the moſt received Opinion of the other two of late years, and the Reaſons may be as followeth: Firſt, their oppoſement is more upon a direct equality than the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as for example, 1 and 8 ſtands upon the right Wing of the Colonels Diviſion which maketh 9; now equally to oppoſe this there is 3 and 6 on the left Wing of the Lieutenant Colonels Diviſion, that maketh 9 alſo; then upon the Right Wing of the Colonels Diviſion there is 4 and 5 that maketh 9; and to oppoſe that there is 2 and 7 which is 9 alſo; all this makes out the juſtneſs of this oppoſement, and in that particular exceeds both the former, for what can be ſaid for the ſecond may be alleadg'd for this third alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> differences in them as to their oppoſements may hereby be diſcerned, and how that all three make equal in numbers, as in half Files and half Ranks, 18 is equal to 18, and in Rank and File making (36.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Indeed</hi> when the Seignior Officers of a Regiment had more Souldiers in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Companies, there was then great reaſon to ſtand upon an equal oppoſement; or elſe one Wing might be too ſtrong for the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All</hi> this being now laid aſide and there being of Souldiers an equality of number in each company, why then ſhould our firſt rule for the dignity of a File be laid aſide for the marching of a Regiment either intire or diviſional? In the ſecond Opinion the ſecond Captain is placed in the Lt. Colonel's diviſions in the third he is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42528:32"/> placed in the Collonels; although I conceive he ought to be in that Diviſion yet he is there miſplaced: for by the ſame rule in the ſecond and third Opinion, as you place the Collonel in the Dignity of a file leader, the Lieutenant Collonel hath his Dignity in the place of a Bringer up, the Major in the place of the half File lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the firſt Captain in the place of the Bringer up to the Front half-files: Thus far all three joyntly go together, and becauſe there is no difference in number of men, but equal in both parties, they need not ſtand ſo much upon an equal oppoſement, but that the ſecond Captain <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. may have his juſt place of honour immediately next unto his Collonel.</p>
                     <p>If it were not for this mode of Dignity according unto a File in the marching of a Regiment, and ſo unto a Rank in a Body, I might as well and better require ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the number of each Company being equal in Souldiers) why there may not be two field officers in the Collonels Diviſion as well as in the Lieutenant Collonels; which I leave to better judgments.</p>
                     <p>For the proof of my aſſertion, as joyning with <hi>Barrife, Ward</hi> and others in apoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond Captain, whoſe is the fift place of Honour next to the File leader, or next to the Collonels own company both in Rank and File.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Bar. pa. <hi>17.</hi>
                        </note>1. The File leader ought to be the worthieſt becauſe he hath the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his File, and marcheth firſt againſt the Enemie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Bringer up ought to be the ſecond place of Honour, becauſe his place of March is in the reer; and is in moſt danger, ſhould the Enemie charge on that part.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The half file leader is the third place of Honour, becauſe when the Front half files are taken off upon any occaſion, he is the leader unleſs he be commanded to face about.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The laſt man (or Bringer up) of the Front half files is the fourth man in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for ſo he is when the Reer Diviſion is taken of.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The next man to the File leader hath the fift place of honour, for one doubling brings him into the Front.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſixt place of Honour is before the Bringer up, for if the Body be faced about, one doubling brings him into that accidental Front, or keeping of his proper Front by once doubling he becomes bringer up to the File leader.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Dignity of place is his who marcheth next after the half file leader, for when the half files double the Front, or march forth, then one doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ranks him even with the Front.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The eight place of Honour (the File being but eight in depth) is the third from the front, for he may be made a File leader alſo, although it may be with more trouble, for by countermarching of the Front and Reere into the midſt, and then facing to the firſt Front, and after doubling of Ranks makes him a File leader alſo.</p>
                     <p>I deſire to ſpeak nothing here to tye up the Ingenious to any particular fancy, when his own reaſon ſhall guide him in this Military Diſcipline, as may not be irregular and contrary to the rules of Art.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now</hi> each Souldier being well exerciſed in the Poſtures of the Pike and Muſquet, and knowing their Dignity both in File and Rank, will not ſtand ſtill here, but muſt be labouring to march farther in this field of Military Diſcipline, that by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof his undaunted courage might conduct him to ſome higher worth or place of Dignity.</p>

                        <hi>A Revally</hi> is beaten in the morning by day light, at which time the ſubofficers are to take off their out Sentinels. It is, when by reaſon of the great noyſe of Guns, men, armes, and Horſes, the Commanders voyce for it can neither be heard or obeyed without the beat of the Drum: And the action of the Souldier whether valiant or otherwiſe is to be guided by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> For the better performance hereof it is the Captains duty to teach his Souldiers diſtinctly the ſeveral beats of the Drum, that they may be the better able to perform their reſpective duties, when ever they ſhall be ſo commanded by the Drum.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> I may truly aſſert that the Diſcipline of a Foot Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſiſteth ſo much in diſtance, and motion, that there is great neceſſitie of learning this very principle; for they are not fixed in one ſtation, but are mutually interchanged one with another, as occaſion is offered by command, and ſo are all brought into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by their diſtances; for if a perfect form of order be not obſerved, diſorder muſt neceſſarily follow; the effect of which produceth confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>And for your better performance in the cloſing and opening of Files and Ranks, take theſe following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When Files open to the right, the left, hand File muſt ſtand faſt; every File taking his diſtance from the File next his left hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When they open to the left the right hand File ſtands faſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Ranks open forward, the laſt rank ſtands; every rank taking his diſtance from the rank next behind him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When they open backward, (or to the reer) the firſt rank ſtands; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. When Files cloſe to the right, the right hand file ſtands, the reſt cloſe to the right, taking their diſtance from the right hand file.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And if Files cloſe to the left, the left hand file ſtands; the reſt of the Files cloſe to the left, and take their diſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. When Files cloſe to the right and left, then they cloſe inward, taking their diſtance from thoſe Files within them, neareſt to the midſt of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When files cloſe to the right and left by Diviſion, it muſt be outwards, according to the fift and ſixt obſervation.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When Ranks cloſe to the front and reer, then the firſt and laſt Ranks ſtand; the other taking their diſtance.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If Ranks cloſe to the midſt then they cloſe towards their two midlemoſt Ranks.</p>
                     <p>I have not uſed the word [Center] in any of theſe Commands, becauſe it is conceived that the word is more proper to a circle, and not to a ſquare, (or a broader fronted body.)</p>
                     <p>It is not of abſolute neceſſity that a Commander in the exerciſe of a private Company ſhall uſe all theſe openings, and cloſings to thoſe ſeveral diſtances men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but ſo many of them, as may be thought fit for his preſent Exerciſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; although it cannot be denied but that they may be uſeful at ſome time or other.</p>

                        <hi>But</hi> the Deputy Lieutenants for the County of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> have allotted ſome files more to each Company, and it is a rare thing to have them compleat in the Field, ſo that it hath been too apparent, becauſe there hath not been an equality in Files, their Companies have been wholly unfit for Exerciſe; but I hope theſe errors will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter looked into and amended hereafter.</p>

Therefore I ſhall only for example ſake ſet down four <hi>Commands,</hi> and demonſtrate them by their reſpective figures, and they only ſhall be performed by the doubling of half Files, leaving the reſt for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Artiſt in this pleaſing exerciſe.</p>

                        </hi> which I anſwer; that what is done by the Front half files, in ſhort is a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Countermarch, (of loſing ground;) but if it were a direct counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march, they ought not to ſtand mixed with any other part of the body, by paſſing through to the Reer, but only to Countermarch into the midſt and there remain; ſo that now paſſing through into the Reer makes it an abſolute doubling.</p>
                     <p>What I have mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter may be ſufficient to the ingenious Artiſt, having concluded what I intended for the ſtrengthening of the Reer.</p>
                     <p>I thought to have inſerted here a ſtrengthening of the Front and Reer, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Chapter of Wheelings, Command the tenth, the inquiſitive may be better ſatisfied.</p>

                     <p>And further, it is adjudged to be moſt convenient for all the Chief Officers to bend their thoughts before the time of Service, to make their Commands as ſhort as poſſible may be, in order to which ſee <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8. and 11.</p>
                     <p>I do declare that I have heard ſome of our late young <hi>Eltoniſts</hi> to be too tedious in their Commands and Reducements; I ſhall adviſe the young Souldier to follow the Rules of <hi>Barriffe, Ward, Bingham</hi> and <hi>Hexham,</hi> for there is in them enough to direct for moſt Services, and then they may peruſe <hi>Elton</hi> at laſt, whoſe worth (as I have been informed) is not to be laid in the duſt without the due reſpects belonging to a Souldier, and I hope now a Loyal Subject.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. That in all <hi>Commands</hi> for Wheelings, ſuch moderation is to be uſed in their motions, that they on the contrary flank be not forced by running to diſorder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall not uſe the word Center, for it is more proper to a Circular body than to a ſquare.</p>
                     <p>Theſe in their Motions (or Actions) are termed either Intire or Diviſional.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Intire Wheelings,</hi> are for the gaining of ground upon the Enemy, or to fight him with your beſt men, as occaſion ſerveth, turning the firſt Aſpect wholly to the <hi>Command</hi> given.</p>

                        <hi>I need</hi> not trouble you with more Angular Wheelings, either wheeling them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the right and left about from the midſt of the Battle;<note place="margin">Part of Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Tacticks: chap. <hi>36. 34. 46.</hi>

                     <p>But I muſt adviſe that thoſe Intire and Diviſional Wheelings may be diligently learnt and practiſed, as being of great uſe in this Military Art.</p>
                     <p>I have in all my method demonſtrated the <hi>Commands</hi> by their Figures to the right hand, you may eaſily command the ſame to the left hand, and the Reducements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>You will find to ſeveral Countermarches and Wheelings no Reducements directed for them, becauſe they may be reduced the ſame way back as was commanded, or by ſome other <hi>Command</hi> as directed.</p>
                     <p>I know but little more to be invented for the ſecure Exerciſe of a Foot Company, (and becauſe I would not be ſingular) I have demonſtrated ſome that may be better ſpared than practiſed in ſervice; however here is for all: Some may make uſe of what is neceſſary to the fitting of the Souldier for field ſervices; and others at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure what their fancy may guide them unto. And thus I have paſſed over the Grounds of Diſcipline for the Foot, I expect Cenſures; by the Ingenuous I ſubmit to a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but for the Carper, let him remain in his own mud, he ſhall never be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to a cleared fountain by me.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of certain firings in the Front.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HAving</hi> paſſed over the grounds of this Art Military, I am now come to the executive part of the <hi>Tacticks;</hi> and ſhall not here exceed the exerciſe of a ſingle Company, ſhewing the Souldier the uſe of ſome few Firings, that they may the better perform their reſpective duties when they ſhall be commanded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>None</hi> can poſitively ſay, this or that figure ſhall be, or ſerve this day, time or place <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe of the diverſity of formes occaſioned by ſituation of ground, he number of men, the order of the Enemy; with many other obſervable Stratagems, for the obtaining both of Wind and Sun.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore according to my allotment of twelve files demonſtrate by figure ſome Firings, which being well underſtood may enable ſuch for higher preferment as time and place may fortune them unto.</p>
                     <p>By way of digreſſion; I am ſure it is a trouble to moſt ingenious ſpirits to ſee ſome Gentlemen choſen Captains in the Militia, that are but priſoners to their own reaſons; and inſtead of being experienced in this Art have been wholly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the leaſt part thereof.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42528:79"/>
                     <p>It is no wonder then if his Majeſty may loſe his expectation of a well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined Militia; and the Souldier in hazzard of his life and Country too.</p>
                     <p>How eaſily might this be remedied, if our Commanding power would but autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the Commiſſion officers to meet once in a moneth to exerciſe each other, by their reſpective turns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where they may alſo diſcourſe and conſult about Military affairs; and then for theſe private Commanders by their affable and heroick perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to get ſome of their ſouldiers as may be for their conveniencie to meet with their armes, and to exerciſe them; this would not only be delightful but profitable both for King and Country.</p>
                     <p>And on the contrary, the neglect hereof, and alſo of the full number of men and Armes in the Militia, hath made it to be ill ſpoken of, and ſo little feared; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by thoſe of our own inbred Enemies to the Royal Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">theſe things will be better looked into hereafter.</note>If they will not be drawn to love and to be obedient to Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, they muſt be made to dread it; And I humbly conceive there is no better way to effect the former than by having a choice Militia, of ſuch whoſe ſpirits ſhould account it a baſeneſs to abuſe the Country; and make not their Muſters, paſs times for debauchery; and that their Companies be not only well diſciplined, but well Armed alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I proceed to the drawing up of files again into a body, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them for skirmiſh.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>A Company of Foot being thus drawn up for ſervice and the Colours flying in the head of the Company, and there they are to remain, until all forlorne firings are ended: But ſo ſoon as the Drumm ſhall beat his further preparatives for a cloſe skirmiſh, the Enſign is to furle his Colours and retreit to the half files of Pikes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That all firings are either direct, or oblique; and the manner how they are to be performed, are either Advancing, Receiving, or Retreiting: otherwhiles there may be firing in the Reer, marching from the Enemy; or in the flank march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an Enemy: and alſo at ſeveral places, for an Enemy may at one and the ſame time charge, either in the Front or Reer, in Front and Reer, alſo in Front, Reer and Flank: and of theſe I ſhall demonſtrate ſome that I at firſt learnt, and ſome amongſt others that are moſt convenient to be learnt.</p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42528:79"/>
                     <p>Now that the Souldier might be expert in his firings againſt the Enemy, let him be often exerciſed with firings only, in the pan, falling off and on as ſhall be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                     <p>All which being well performed by the Muſquetteers is a full accompliſhment of what hath been before taught him, by which the Commander ſhall be credited, and the Souldier preferred to his merit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of firing by forlorne files.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That which is to be uſed in our modern exerciſe is two manner of wayes; the two outmoſt files of each flank of Muſquetteers to march with two Serjeants ſo far as ſhall be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and there to ſtand: and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ranks are to give fire and to fall into the Reer of themſelves, either by wheeling off to the right, or to the right and left: Then let the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do the like and fall into their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                        <figDesc>ranks and files</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Thoſe that have fired are to fall off on the inſide of the Muſquetteers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Pikes; and as they are thus trooping back (after firing) to their places, the reſt are in like manner to move away, and fire, and fall in next the Pikes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Accordingly</hi> as you draw out two files, ſo you may draw out more files to the number of Muſquetteers; and ſo to fire and fall into the Reer of themſelves, and places &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:42528:80"/>3. You may move them all clear of the Pikes, and let them open from the midſt, leaving ſufficient Intervals for their wheelings in the Reer of themſelves, and then to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even with their Pikes, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond having fired as before place themſelves in the Reer of the firſt diviſion &amp;c.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>ranks and files</figDesc>

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Advance</hi> the two outmoſt files by the Serjeants, who are to lead them to the place for execution as by order received; <hi>Commanding</hi>

                     <p>I proceed to a ſecond way of firing and that is by Ranks.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By advancing before the Front.</p>

                     <p>Advancing before the Front may be performed by advancing of ſingle ranks, and ſo firing in the Front; or by advancing of both flanks into the Front before the Pikes, and ſo to fire by ſingle ranks. Which is performed by <hi>Commanding</hi>

                     <p>I mention nothing to tye up the hand of the ingenious to any ſtinted form, whoſe ablities may command his figures at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that when the forlorn files or Ranks march out, they are to give fire as upon a retreit (that is) to ſtand and fire, and wheel off that their followers may do the like, unleſs the Enemy give ground.</p>
                     <p>And when the two laſt ranks were preſented, the next two ranks muſt be ready to march forward being fixed to preſent and give fire alſo: Thus having fired in the Front by one ſingle Rank, or more, they are by wheeling off to place themſelves in the Reer of their own diviſions before the Pikes; the reſt doing the like until they have all fired round.</p>

                        <hi>This</hi> is not our drift of firing in the Reer; but if in a March an Enemy eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues and aſſaults, then by facing about and firing in the Reer, or by Countermarching, or Wheeling about, and ſo firing; theſe repulſes orderly performed may cauſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the purſuants: And it is good ſometimes as occaſion may offer to keep an Enemy in play, whilſt he may advantage himſelf in his Ground, either for his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battlement, or Ambuſhes, or for the conveyances of Gunns or other Carriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Firing.</hi> Upon a March the laſt Rank is to face about, and ſo to give fire, wheeling off in File by Diviſion, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up towards the Front, and placing themſelves before their File-leaders.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that whilſt the rank of Muſquetteers are firing in the Reer, the next rank al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be marching, he ought to be preparing with his cock bent and garded, that with his three motions, he may next fire ſo ſoon as his precedent rank is wheeled off.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42528:86"/>4. Although you are upon a march, yet you are to fall one rank nearer to the Reer, that the Body may be preſerved intire.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Obſerve</hi> further in the performance of all this, your preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and firings ought to be at three motions:<note place="margin">Cock your match, Blow your coal, Preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Let the firſt be with the right leg advancing, the ſecond with the left leg advancing, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your cock; then a little advancing forward with the right foot, to preſent and give fire.</p>
                     <p>Now I give theſe Reaſons for the Obſervations of ſome motions in theſe firings to the Reer; becauſe ſo ſoon as the Souldier hath fired, if the laſt rank ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly face about and preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there would be a preſent incumbrance; This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath diſcovered, and that firing upon motion to be the moſt ſpeedieſt and ſafeſt way for firing in the Reer.</p>
                     <p>Now for a Publick Exerciſe, when you have fired over once, you may then face them to their Leader, and fire in the Front.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> if you be upon a march, and ſhould be purſued by an Enemies Horſe, then Wheel your Flanks into the Front, and face to the Reer; your Pikes will defend your Body, ſo your Muſquetteers may fire over them as in the 17. Figure by extraduction, and reduced accordingly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In firing to the Reer, the Muſquetteers may be in the Reer of the Pikes. And firſt having fired they are to wheel off and place themſelves between the Front of Muſquetteers and Reer of Pikes. And ſecondly, having fired in the Reer they may wheel off by Diviſion and march into the Front of Pikes, the Body ſtill marching. Or, if both flanks be in the Reer, they may fire &amp; wheel off by Diviſion, and double both flanks.</p>
                     <p>This laſt hath reduced it ſelf; and for the ſecond you may for exerciſe, fire them in the Front, and in their wheeling off to flank their Pikes; or for expedition, for the Muſquetteers to open to the right and left, and march the Pikes up in the interval, and they are reduced as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You</hi> may perceive the uſe of firings in the Reer, and that the Souldier ought to be very well exerciſed in them: For a true experience herein doth not only add to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Souldier, but his ſafety alſo.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I ſhall add two Figures of firing in Front and Reer marching.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of Firings in the Flanks.</head>
                     <p>THere are reaſons to be given, and Experience hath found it neceſſary, for firing in the Flanks: When you are upon a March, an Enemy may endeavour an aſſault to moleſt you in your paſſages, that your diſadvantages may be the greater, either by ambuſhments laid againſt you, or to fruſtrate your deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Now in the performance hereof there are ſeveral circumſtances that are to be taken notice of, as the ſtrength of your Enemy, the time, number and place; all for your own ſecurity, or advantages againſt him.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin with ſome Exerciſes upon the right flank, and what is performed there by Figure, may alſo be performed upon the left hand.</p>
                     <p>In order hereunto paſs all your Muſquetteers into your right flank by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding:</hi>
                        <q>Muſquetteers of the right Flank open to the right, and being opened to a convenient diſtance, ſtand; then Muſquetteers of the left Flank, paſs through your Ranks of Pikes to the interval of the right Flank, then ſtand, and face to your Leader.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your facings to the right or left, is that, by which the flanks become accidental fronts, and then for the firings thereupon, you may to your diſcretion uſe ſuch as are moſt convenient; being already ſhewn <hi>Chapter</hi> 18. I ſhall not here take up any room with the demonſtrations thereof, and ſhall ſhew but ſome few firings in the right flank, as the Body ſhall be marching, in all which you are to obſerve the Pikes are to be ſhouldered.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42528:87"/>1. <hi>Command.</hi> Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetteers give fire to the right, and wheel after your Bringers-up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Diviſions.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>ranks and files</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>And this at the diſcretion of the Commander is done two wayes, either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to be lead into their places by their File-leader, or by their Bringers-up, and to place themſelves before them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here by this Figure, they in the firſt place, as the Body is marching, face to the right (the outmoſt File) preſents and gives fire: after their firing, they face to the right, and after their Bringer-up, who leads them off in the Reer of the Muſquetteers, and up into the Interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pikes and Muſquets, until the Bringer-up of the File hath placed himſelf even in breaſt with the Frontiers; and ſo the marching Party, as <hi>Command</hi> ſhall be given, are to open, that the Files of Muſquetteers after they have fired may march up between the Diviſions, and ſo every File is ſucceſſively to fire, and wheel off and place it ſelf. This firing being performed twice over they are <hi>Reduced:</hi> If but once, you muſt countermarch your files of Muſquetteers to reduce them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>You</hi> may ſecondly after they have fired, <hi>Command</hi> them to face to the right, and to wheel off, every man placing himſelf before his Bringer up (or preſent Leader) hereby the Bringer up will be in his due place and the file-leader in his proper place, alſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A Third</hi> way of firing upon this Figure, is to fire in the right flank, and to be lead off into their places by their reſpective File-leaders.</p>
                     <p>The Body marching, the outmoſt File faceth to the right and fires, and when the body is marched clear of the ſtanding file, then the next file preſents to the right and fires, and whileſt he is firing, the firſt file that is fired faceth to the left, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up between the Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers and Pikes. Obſerving the former directions in their march, that there may be ſpace enough in the Interval for the ſeveral Files ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to march into theſe places.</p>

                     <p>The Body marching the outmoſt file faceth to the right, fires, then ſtands, and faceth to their Leader: Then when the Body is clear of the ſtanding file, the ſecond file faceth to the right, and fires and ſtands alſo, facing to their Leader; then the firſt file is to advance up to the ſecond, and ſo when the firſt and ſecond have fired they are to be lead up to the third. Thus having fired, they are to be lead up even in breaſt to the file that laſt fired, and having all fired, they are to be marcht up even with the Front Pikes.</p>

                     <p>How beneficial this may be to the ſecurity of the Souldier, they that will make uſe of it that are ingenious will better judge: but I am of opinion it is more fit for a private Exerciſe, than for publick Service.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Command.</hi> Give fire to the right, and place your ſelves even in Front with the Pikes, marching up between the midſt of the Pikes.</p>

                     <p>I Might here make mention of a great many Figures for firings, ſome ſerviceable, and others not, but all left to the judicious for cenſure, and to make uſe of the beſt; yet none uſeleſs for delight or Garden Exerciſes: The Figures cannot be perfect becauſe I am tied to the exerciſe but of twelve Files, four of them Pikes and eight Muſquetteers; it being a Number that our Weſtern Commanders can make uſe of, and no more; yet any who may be capable to perform them, will be able to invent others; and command the production of ſuch like in geater Numbers, and with better delight.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Command.</hi> The two outmoſt Files upon each Flank ſtand; the two inmoſt half Ranks of the Reer face about to the right: the two inmoſt half Ranks both of Front and Reer, march until you are clear of the Body of Pikes; then half Files rank to the right and left inwards by wheeling into the Front.</p>
                     <p>For the Pikes, open them to the right and left from the midſt; then <hi>Command</hi> the right and left hand File of Pikes to ſtand; the Reer half Files of the remainder face about to the right, then both half Files rank to the right and left inward into the Front and Reer.</p>
                     <p>This Figure in great Bodies muſt be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed otherways, and may be very ſerviceable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Horſe; the Pikes may advance into the Front of Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers to ſecure them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Horſes fury if occaſion ſhall ſerve.</p>

                     <p>This being done paſs through the Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers before the ſeveral Fronts of Pikes, as they were before any firing.</p>

                     <p>IT may be expected I ſhould treat alſo of large Battalias, or great numbers of men; demonſtrating of them likewiſe by their ſeveral Plat-forms: But having my Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber proportioned, as you ſee by my ſeveral exerciſes, I have ſtretched them as far as is convenient, that by their figures they may be ſo well underſtood, that when larger numbers are before you, your Commands may be performed with more delight and ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>But before the Drum beates a march to depart the field, I ſhall briefly declare, That in grand Battalias (or field ſervices) the Souldier fires by vollies, or (as termed by ſome) Salves of ſhott; that is, when they are to fire intirely by two or three Ranks, or more, as your number will permit, and occaſion require; thereby powring ſhowers of lead upon your Enemy: Now this way of firing, and thoſe alſo of gaining ground I could wiſh the Souldier ſhould be often experienced in: The Commander in taking pains with his Souldier cannot be the worſe for it, and I am ſure the Souldier much the better; being fitted thereby to meet his Enemy in any field ſervice, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall have occaſion to Command him. For that Commander that is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in this Art Military finds that thoſe who know but little more than the Theory part, are oftimes puſled (or at a ſtand.)</p>
                     <p>What can ſuch who are but meer Bookleidgers do? when their Number of men is wanting; or nature in place ſparing to their advantage or intentions; ſuch when they are forced to action, they will fail of their expectation, and at laſt muſt be beholding to others that are better Artiſts, or elſe it may prove a fatal ruin to both.</p>
                     <p>Some of my friends might think that I ſhould treat alſo ſomewhat concerning the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Officers in marching &amp; in placing of them in field ſervices: but that belonging to Commanders of an higher degree, it would be preſumption in me to lay down rules for them to follow; for any Minor Officer that for his ſatisfaction will be pleaſed to view the third Chapter of theſe Obſevations, he may underſtand the method and mode thereof; and I hold it in my judgment, that all dignitie in marching of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from a file; and the drawing up of Companies for a Battalia, is from a Rank.</p>

                     <p>For the firſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> had three hundred and eighteen men in his Houſe fitted for War, upon ſhort warning. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed the people how to encamp by their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42528:95"/> under the Enſigns of their fathers Houſes. <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Judges,</hi> under whom of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> were four hundred and forty thouſand, ſeven hundred and ſixty men exerciſed in Wars. You may read of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> of <hi>Aſa,</hi> of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> whoſe care in this particular is moſt plentifully declared.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the complaint for want of Arms. We read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Judges, Was there a ſhield or a Spear ſeen among forty thouſand in Iſrael?</hi> This queſtion is a plain negative, there was not; here is that <hi>Defectus Remedii,</hi> the want of help: Great was their miſery, but no remedy; not a Spear to offend, nor not ſo much as a Shield to defend; War was at their Gates, yet neither offenſive nor defenſive weapon to aſſiſt: Such an extremity as this was will cauſe all to be loſt; either preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, or in future poſſibilities, ſo that hope and help in ſuch extremities muſt be laid aſide.</p>
                     <p>There was likewiſe a great diſtreſs in the time of <hi>Saul;</hi> when the ſpoilers were come out from the Philiſtins, there was neither Sword nor Spear found in any of the hands of the people that were with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> (but with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> only) yet although here was a great want they had victory. It is well known that God can give victory by ſmall means, (and as the Apoſtle ſaid to Chriſt, Maſter, here are two Swords; he anſwered it is enough. He can give your Enemies into your hands with two Swords, with one Sword, with no Sword.) All this was to convince the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God fought for them, to move them to bleſs the Lord,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Fifth monarchy men.</note>Although ſome have been ſuch audacious Rebels to think their zeal ſhould even beck God Almighty, or to command power and aid from him to fight for them; therefore boldly attempted of late, ſaying that ten ſhould chaſe an hundred and an hundred a thouſand: But through the unjuſtneſs of their undertakings (and fewneſs in Number) they muſt ſink; to convince them and all others upon any pretence of Religion that will be ſuch Rebellious diſſenters, God Almighty will not only fight againſt them, but will deliver them into the hands of Juſtice, to magnifie his own power in bringing ſuch to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the end and uſe of Armes; It is for the recovery of our juſt rights which wrongfully have been detained; or for the preſervation of them, againſt any oppoſer either forraign or domeſtick: For theſe ends Armes may be uſed, and War proclaimed; yet not by any other way or pretence, but by and with his Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof whether juſt or unjuſt; by which we are to be either incouraged or diſcouraged.</p>
                     <p>A juſt cauſe may be farther conſidered in the Peace of the People, the ſafety of the Countrey, and the Glory of the Kingdom: As to the firſt, there was never any War intended but to make way for Peace, (it is a baſe end to deſire Peace, by which to leavy a force againſt an unjuſt War) but ſo to deſire a juſt War that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be ſettled a well grounded peace.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing that may be conſidered is the health and ſafety of the Countrey: ſome muſt be endangered that all may not be deſtroyed: I could wiſh that our Chiefetains and Gentlemen with thoſe dull, leaded ſpirits of our rotten Country — and miſerable worldlings would conſider for whoſe ſakes the worthy Souldier ſpares neither time nor purſe in this Noble Exerciſe; but even for them and theirs, theirs and their Children; yet they muſt be judged moſt contemptible; rather than to countenance them, ſome will burden them in their rates and taxes, and keep their juſt dues and payes from them: yet conſider who it is that muſt preſerve your Cities and Countries, Temples and Pallaces, Trafficks and Marketts, Ships and Shops, from ruine, deſolation and deſtruction; but the Souldier under God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Glory of a Kingdom lyeth much in a people well diſciplin'd in the Art of War. That Prince that maketh it his deſignes to have his people inſtructed and trained up in Military exerciſes, will make his Enemies to fear him both at home and abroad: And that people that ſhall juſtly be called forth upon theſe principles, need not fear of being conquerours.</p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42528:95"/>
                     <p>A juſt cauſe may be ſpoiled through the ill management thereof, or through perfidious dealings.</p>
                     <p>A Rebellious Conquerour may make lawes even to death it ſelf, to maintain his Victory; as our late Uſurpation hath experienced: But at laſt the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with an eye of admiration, to ſee how miraculouſly God reſtored his Majeſty to his Crown and Dignities; the Church and People to their juſt rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>I do affirme and truly ſay of Soveraign Power, Kingdomes, Lawes and Armies, as was ſaid of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Twins, they laugh and weep together, they live and die together; for as without Lawes the Soveraign power and the Common-wealth cannot ſubſiſt by reaſon of diſorders within; ſo without Armes, and the exerciſe of them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſafe by reaſon of dangers without.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall further and briefly prove that the ſafety both of King and people is much advanced by the exerciſe of Armes: although <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>In the multitude of people is the honour of a King, and for want of people cometh deſtruction.</hi> Notwithſtanding I may affirm that ſafety is not in a multitude of men without weapons, and skill to manage them. It is aſſerted <hi>That Counſel and ſtrength are for War;</hi> Then, how ſhall Counſell and ſtrength be eſtabliſhed,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.</note> without education and inſtruction to ſervice? and how ſhall a man be inſtructed without Military Exerciſes? There are ſome diſadvantages that happen in Wars, partly by reaſon of the ſuddainneſs of the War, and partly in reſpect of the inequality and odds betwixt party and party; Now Souldiers without dexterity and skill, can never be able to extricate themſelves out of ſuch difficulties as may befall them: All which proves that the exerciſe of Armes is to be allowed and Commanded.</p>
                     <p>And as I told you at firſt I have heard ſome ſay, that we live in Goſpel times, which are to be times of Peace, and not of war, therefore there needeth not thoſe Exerciſes of Armes as you reaſon for <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is argued by ſome out of covetouſneſs to ſave their expences; but are ready to declare when there is occaſion, then they will be in a readineſs to do their beſt: There are others of a Fanatick humour,<note place="margin">He ſpeaketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the uſe of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons or lawfull War.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now in anſwer hereunto we muſt oppoſe it by another ſaying in <hi>Joel,</hi> where the people were called upon <hi>to beat their plough ſhares into ſwords, and their pruning hooks into Spears.</hi>

                     <p>For the reconciling hereof the learned ſay that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was to diſtinguiſh between the purpoſe and intent of Chriſts coming into the world, and the other ſheweth the ſucceſs and event which was accidental in reſpect of mans malice: Again to the firſt of theſe they argue what Chriſt ſaid to Saint <hi>Peter, Put up thy Sword, for he that ſtrikes with the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> But I pray you obſerve what he ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>That he that hath no Sword, let him ſell his coat and buy a Sword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although the end of Chriſts coming was to reconcile things in Heaven and things on earth; I have been further taught by the Learned that this is attained unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us in our Juſtification; and will be accompliſhed between man and man in the day of Redemption: Yet as long as there is a Sathanical Spirit in the children of diſobedience, and ſo long as there is a remnant of ſin in the heart of any, there will be Diviſions, <hi>Familiſts, Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> All being refractory to the preſent commands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which ſheweth a neceſſity to have a care and prepare for the exerciſe of Armes; That none of theſe by their Uſurpation may for ever hereafter ſnatch the Trumpets out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hands; nor the Trumpet only, but the Sword alſo, nor the Sword alone but the Crown and Scepter alſo: Now by this mutual exerciſe of Armes I doubt not but in a litttle time God Almighty will unite the affections of moſt againſt ſuch as ſhall exalt themſeves above all that is called God.</p>

                     <p>Let me excite all to be diligent, in the uſe of the meanes, to make themſelves able and fit Souldiers and Commanders, by often Exerciſing, and willing to get com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Armes, to be exerciſed in Martial diſpipline; conſidering how ill it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when there was not a ſhield to be found amongſt 40000 men; And conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain how worthy of praiſe it was to Martial Diſcipline in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had 170000 every one able to lead an Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>I muſt tell you we have not our peace by Patent, we know not how long it may continue, Let war therefore be provided for, as to train up ſome to military practiſes: If War ſhould come, it is labour well ſpent; If not, it is a labour well loſt. Long preparations make a ſhort and quick victory.</p>
                     <p>Some are apt to ſay we have Souldiers enough, we will all fight when occaſion ſhall ſerve; Let me tell ſuch that they that never tried it, think it a pleaſure to fight, and they will fight ſtrangely, if they have no weapons, and uſe their weapons more ſtrangely if they have no skill:<note place="margin">Re Milita. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi>
                        </note> It is a ſaying of <hi>Vegetius, Non de pugna, ſed de fuga cogitant, qui nudi in acie exponuntur ad Vulnera.</hi> Their minds are not ſo much on fighting as fleeing, that are expoſed to War without weapons; and a Souldier may be almoſt as well without them as not to know how to uſe them.</p>
                     <p>Now that the Souldier may not be failing herein, and that his Majeſtie may never want able Souldiers in the Country as well as in the City; I moſt humbly beg, and crave pardon in preſuming to preſent it, That the Muſter maſter in every Countrey ſhould be a careful unbyaſſed perſon, an able Souldier, and one whom the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Gentlemen love and affect, who ſhould be alwayes by authority to attend at ſuch times and places, as ſhall be thought convenient to exerciſe and teach the Art of Military diſcipline to all that ſhall willingly imbrace it; And if his pay be too little for him, to make it his buſineſs and to attend upon it: It may be then aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented without any trouble; and the Souldier will be found much more capable for ſervice when commanded.</p>
                     <p>There muſt be exerciſe or elſe mens ſpirits will grow reſtie: what turnes to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction ſooner than ſtanding water? what is Vertue without Action?

                     <p>The ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> were ſaid to be the moſt Warlike and Valiant men of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But how became they ſuch?

                        </note> for it was their Cuſtome, to come Armed to their Councils.</p>
                     <p>Their applauſe of any Oration was ſignified by clattering of their Armes, and their Oathes taken were upon their Armes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Germaines</hi> were wont to go Armed about their negotiations, and to their Banquets.</p>
                     <p>The moſt Warlike Nations in the world have accounted it a piece of policy, to be frequent in the uſe of Armes: Why ſhould not the laudableneſs of ſuch martial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes perſwade men to love and imbrace the uſe of them?</p>
                     <p>We read ſome preſidents for it; of <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſhooting for ſport that he might be thereby fitted to War. And without doubt the <hi>Benjamites</hi> attained that dexterity in caſting ſtones out of a ſling at an haires breadth by frequent exerciſe for recreation.</p>
                     <p>And may I not affirm, by the Exerciſe of Arms that Empires, Kingdoms and Common-wealths have come to their heigth and Soveraignty, and have ſo maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their State in happineſs and proſperity? and by neglecting of the ſame, they have declined and decayed, and at laſt have been made Preys to their Enemies: How were thoſe Empires and Monarchies of the <hi>Egyptians, Medians, Parthians, Perſians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> eſtabliſhed and greatly augmented by this <hi>Military Art;</hi> And how was the Dominion of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Empire preſerved and wonderfully inlarged by the Art and Diſcipline of great <hi>Alexander</hi> with ſmall Armies of well ordered and exerciſed Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?

                     <p>Now that people that is not incouraged, or rather compelled by good Laws to practiſe and exerciſe Arms, or any thing elſe belonging to this <hi>Military Art;</hi> they will in a ſhort time for want of ſuch Manlike, Martial Orders and Exerciſes, grow into Sloth, to Covetouſneſs, to Drunkenneſs, and Vicious Effeminacies, and to all other Evils as Nature ſhall incline them unto; by the which they in a ſhort time do become unfit to be imployed in any War offenſive, and unable to defend themſelves if they ſhould be invaded.</p>

                     <p>And about the Year 1353. we read that the Princes of <hi>Greece,</hi> aided by the <hi>Deſpote</hi> or Duke of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> did revolt againſt <hi>John Paleologus</hi> at that time Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> who for his ſafety againſt thoſe Revolters entered into a League with <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> the firſt, and third King of the Houſe of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and had his Aſſiſtance with ten thouſand of his Horſe-men; who by their good order and well diſciplined Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did prevail againſt his Revolters, and brought them to obedience: But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? <hi>Amurat</hi> being informed of the great riches thoſe <hi>Graecians</hi> had, together with their weakneſs, by reaſon of their diſorder in Military Affairs, tranſported an Army over the <hi>Aſian</hi> Seas into <hi>Greece,</hi> and by that Invaſion took many Cities and Towns, and did afterwards by battle ſlay the Duke of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> and <hi>Servia,</hi> with many others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there placed himſelf over a great part of their Dominion: So about fourſcore years after, <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond Emperour of the Turks ſeeing <hi>Conſtantine Paleologus</hi> then Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> without any ſettled <hi>Militia,</hi> and his people grown luxurious and not able to reſiſt him by Battle, did in the Year 1453. beſiege the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who within two Months by aſſault won the ſaid City, and put the Emperour, Empreſs, and their young Princes, with an infinite number of Men, Women and Children to the ſword.</p>
                     <p>I might give a great many more Inſtances as to our own Country from the <hi>Saxons</hi> to the <hi>Normans;</hi> and what Hiſtory ſpeaks later of our ſelves, I muſt leave that to our Reformers to conſider how uſeful and neceſſary the exerciſe of Arms is to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of a Nation and people.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> that Excellent Prince being very skilful in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both in War and Peace, ſpeaking to his Men of War ſaid; The Military Diſcipline of our Anceſtours doth maintain and preſerve out State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; but if we do neglect the ſame, and make no account of the Orders and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of it, We, our name and Reputation of <hi>Romans,</hi> and therewith all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, are loſt and forgotten.</p>
                     <p>Though the frequent uſe of Arms in Exerciſe is moſt commendable, becauſe of the ſpecial helps it hath in making us fit and ſerviceable Inſtruments of the Publick well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: Yet I adviſe it with theſe Cautions.</p>

                     <p>OF this Subject I never thought to have ſpoken any thing,<note place="margin">1670.</note> but this laſt Summer perceiving moſt Enſigns (having that Honour aſſigned them by Commiſſion) knew but little what belonged to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and think it a thing of little or no difficulty, but only a Rag or Mark, which any man may carry, ſo it be born up, or ſwung about mens cars, and ſometimes in the teeth of ſuch which are next unto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> for the Election of theſe Officers by ſome new Commiſſionated Captains; It is not by the greatneſs of his skill, but the largeneſs of his body; not how able he is in his mind, but how ſtrong he is in his Arms; not what is his Spirit, Activity, Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, but what is his wealth, and how near he is allyed to the Captain in blood, friendſhip, or ſervice; or ſome other beholdingneſs to him, for this piece of Honour: As if this Place deſerved nothing elſe, but a meer Man, or ſome Friend: For when ſhall you ſee an Enſign almoſt in any Imployment, more than in ordinary Marches, or ſtanding ſtill, and obſerving other mens Actions? When ſhall you ſee either Captain or Lieutenant, teach the Enſign his Poſtures, or the Dignity of his Place, his demeanour before Kings, Princes and Potentates; and other his ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Superiours; his State and Gard to his Equals, and his Humanity and Courteſie to his Inferiours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am</hi> ſure that ſome are ſo far from making inquiry after theſe diſcoveries that you ſhall ſee ſome Enſigns let fly their Colours, when they ſhould ſink them; and ſome to ſtoop them to Peſants or Comrades, when Superiours have gone unſaluted: There are a great many other abſurdities, but I ſhall hereby endeavour a Reformation; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may not be to the ſatisfaction of all, yet I will lay open and plain what I know of theſe Concerns, as not to puzzle him who is deſirous to learn, nor lull aſleep with amazement the weakeſt capacity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore</hi> in the firſt place I ſhall endeavour to declare the Original and firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Enſigns (or Colours) in the Wars, and how they have grown up by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continue as now they are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It's</hi> true, that the Antient Hiſtorians and Heathen Writers, hold divers Opinions, touching the firſt beginning of Enſigns: Some deriving of them (eſpecially the old Poets) from <hi>Hercules;</hi> in imitation of his Lyons skin: Others take the beginning from <hi>Perithou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>There</hi> be others which ſuppoſe, that the firſt Enſign was born or carried before <hi>Theſeus,</hi> when he went to combate with <hi>Hippolyta,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> whom he bravely conquered and afterward married.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now</hi> as theſe, ſo many other Writers ſuppoſe divers other beginners of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: Some lay it upon <hi>Mercury,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Caduceus:</hi> Some upon <hi>Vulcan,</hi> when he forged <hi>Mars</hi> a Shield, and an Armour; and ſome upon <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe Enſign was Thunder and Lightning.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42528:98"/> but muſt fly to the truth it ſelf; which is ever a faithful and a conſtant Warrant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We</hi> find in holy Writ that the greateſt Chieftain that ever led Army upon the Earth was <hi>Moſes,</hi> the great ſervant of the great God; He was truly <hi>Dux</hi> a Duke, a Leader, ſuch a Duke and ſuch a Leader, as after him (Chriſt excepted) was never the like ſeen in the World; and the Army which he lead, was the greateſt, ſtrongeſt, and moſt fortunate in Number, Power, and in all manner of hazardous Actions, that ever the World ſaw, or the Sun ſhined upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now</hi> we find this Duke, this Prince over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the holy appointment of God himſelf was the firſt that began true <hi>Martial Diſcipline;</hi> for as himſelf was General over that huge Body; ſo for the well diſpoſing and governing of every particular member, he conſtituted and appointed ſeveral Colonels over the ſeveral Tribes, and under every Colonel ſeveral Captains, as Commanders in Chief over particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, who as Inferiours did execute the Commands of their Superiours, and had alſo executed under them, by others, whatſoever they lawfully commanded, that was for the good and benefit of the Army. As thus he divided the twelve Tribes into twelve war-like Bodies; ſo alſo he ordained them ſeveral Enſigns or Banners, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with twelve ſeveral Marks or Diviſions, under which they marched; which by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath and proteſtation they were bound to guard and follow in all places and all dangers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By</hi> theſe Enſigns and tokens of Honour, the Tribes were firſt of all diſtinguiſhed and known one from another; and by the carriage of them in the field, and their waving and proſpects in their ſeveral places, was the dignity of place and precedency of greatneſs firſt known; the Elder being diſtinguiſhed by his Enſign or Mark from the younger, the greater from the leſs, and the eminent and more ſuperiour from thoſe of lower rank and inferiour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Although</hi> we have a large <hi>Baſis</hi> to ſuperſtruct our imitations upon, yet there was not the general uſe of Enſigns then, as now there is; for theſe Enſigns were due only to the great Colonel, or chief head of the Tribes, not to every particular Company, but to one Tribe was allowed but one Enſign, and after one manner and form; ſo as <hi>Simeon</hi> may not carry that of <hi>Levi,</hi> nor <hi>Levi</hi> that of <hi>Judah;</hi> but were tied to their own Colours: Alſo if that one Tribe were divided into many Bodies, yet did they not carry ſeveral Enſigns, but every Body the Enſign of his own Tribe; ſo that Companies were not diſtinguiſhed by their Captains or Chiefs, but by their Tribes; nor could they ſay there goes ſuch a particular Commander, but there is ſuch a Tribe; not there marches <hi>Aaron,</hi> but there marches the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> and thus of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence,</hi> and from this ground was taken up the uſe of the Enſigns, or Banners of Kingdoms, by which ſeveral Armies diſplay to the World their ſeveral Nations; as with us in <hi>England,</hi> we have the Enſign of St. <hi>George,</hi> (as we term it) which is a bloody Croſs in a white field, which ſhews to the world not what private Company I follow, but what King I ſerve, and what Country I acknowledge; for howſoever private Captains are allowed their Enſigns for private reſpects or diſtinctions; yet they are not allowed (or to be born on foot) without this general Enſign of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: for thus it holdeth in all Chriſtian Kingdoms, and amongſt the Turks alſo, as appeareth by their Creſſant or Half Moon in all their Armies, as the Enſign of their Univerſal Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> you ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt (and that by the Commandment of God himſelf) began Enſigns, which by ſucceſſion of time, deſcended and came down with a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe, unto the days of <hi>Maccabees;</hi> for the Tribes then being diſperſed far and wide, and made Kings of many ſpatious and fruitful Countries; they took liberty to alter their Enſigns, according to their own fancies: The glory thereof when it came to the cares of the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> (for <hi>Alexander</hi> is ſuppoſed to reign in the time of the <hi>Maccabees</hi>) they took to themſelves a lawful imitation thereof, and ſo commanded their Captains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to carry in their Enſigns, Devices in honour of their Renown and Conqueſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then</hi> from the imitations of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> took to themſelves the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42528:98"/> carriage of Enſigns; and becauſe they found it the chiefeſt beauty and ornament of Armies, they made it therefore the nobleſt and richeſt ſpoil which could poſſibly be taken away from the Enemy; and ſo made it an hereditary right for any man that ſhould take (in honourable faſhion) ſuch ſpoyls, ever after to bear them, as his own, to him and his Poſterity for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The <hi>Romans</hi>
                        </hi> firſt brought this cuſtom into the Monarchy of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> when <hi>Caeſar</hi> firſt invaded and got footing into the ſame: Howſoever there is an opinion taken that <hi>Brute,</hi> when he firſt conquered this Iſland, brought in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Enſigns, and other Ornaments of their Wars; yet it is certain that through Civil Diſſentions, and other Forreign Combuſtions, all theſe Honourable Marks were loſt and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and only the <hi>Romans</hi> renewed and brought them back unto memory, partly by their glory and example, and partly by their loſs when they were repulſed back; who left behind them many of theſe ſpoyls to adorn the <hi>Britains:</hi> From theſe times hath the uſe of Enſigns remained amongſt us; and as the Ages have ſucceeded, and proved wiſer and wiſer, and one time more than another, ſo hath the alteration of theſe Emblems (or Enſigns) changed and brought themſelves into the form wherein they are at this inſtant carried; as the <hi>Romans</hi> varyed from the old <hi>Britains,</hi> ſo the <hi>Saxons</hi> from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> from the <hi>Saxons:</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> then being the moſt refined Nation of all other, altering from them all; and now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all into this preſent mode of Uniformity, they may diſplay them to the World for their Gallantry.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>AFter</hi> the Original, Antiquity, and firſt beginning hath been endeavoured to be made to appear; I ſhall now deſcend to the definition and diſtinction of them; and by what proper names they were called in the beſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Wars of Chriſtendom, and for what reaſon they have held and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> begin with the firſt and moſt antient name belonging to Enſigns, I think it not amiſs to borrow it from the <hi>Romans;</hi> for although the <hi>Hebrews, Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> were the firſt Inventers, yet the Names and Attributes they gave them, were much incertain and unconſtant, and as the experience of Wars grew great, and as the Invention dilated and ſpread further, ſo did the ſignification alter; for what was proper and ſubſtantial in this Age, in the next was utterly loſt and forgotten, ſo as I ſhall not reſt upon theſe Titles or ſignifications.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> firſt then that retained a conſtant and firm ſettled name for thoſe Trophies of Honour, is taken to be the <hi>Romans,</hi> who indeed being the greateſt School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters in the Art of War, are the moſt worthy to be held for Imitation or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> name which the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt gave to the Enſign, or him that carried the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (for to the man was ever attributed the Contents of the thing he carried) was <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,</hi> or Sign bearing, (and ſo Enſign-bearer) becauſe they carried in thoſe Enſigns, Marks, Empreſſaes or Emblems, beſt agreeing with their natures and condition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Inventions; or elſe the Pourtraictures of their former Battles and Conqueſts; either of which was ſo honourable, that indeed they were made Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; deſcending down to their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from Generation to Generation: And no more were called Signs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Coat-Armour, or the Honour of the Families; nor were they of ſlight or ordinary eſteem, as at firſt; neither had men liberty any longer to make election of them at their own Wills, but this power was incabinated
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42528:99"/> within the breaſt of Emperours, Kings and Generals, who indeed (under God) are the unbounded Oceans of Honour, they only have the liberty of beſtowing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Honour at their own pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence</hi> it came that Enſigns thus carrying of Coat-Armours, were of ſuch reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend eſteem, that men took it for the honourableſt place that might be, to fall near or about the Enſign; and for the defence of it, no hazzard could be too great, nor any torment inſupportable: So that many times the Zeal of thoſe that did defend theſe Enſigns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the inflamed deſire or greedineſs of thoſe which ſought to conquer and atchieve them, was ſo immeaſurable and unbounded, that an infinite of blood hath been ſhed, and many powerful Armies overthrown, only for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of one of theſe honourable Trophies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> when the wiſdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> perceived, and that thoſe <hi>Inſignias</hi> were not Bugbears to affright, but rather fires, which did inflame their Enemies courage beyond their proper natures; they forthwith forbad the carrying of any Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Device in their Enſigns; but only ſuch ſlight inventions, as might not make the Enemy much the richer by the enjoyment thereof, nor themſelves much the poorer by the loſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> hence it followed that the word <hi>Inſignia</hi> was put out of uſe, and they then called the Enſign <hi>Anteſignia,</hi> and made other Devices contrary to all Coat-Armour; intimating to the Enemy that whatſoever they got by thoſe purchaſes, was diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable rather than any way worthy of Triumph: And from this word <hi>Anteſignia,</hi> or <hi>Anteſigne,</hi> (for it hath been ſo written in antient Records) it hath been judged that this word <hi>Antient</hi> in many places uſed amongſt us, and given to our Enſigns, hath been corruptly retained by us; for it hath no coherence in ſignification, nor can any way be alluded unto this Officer, more than to his Antiquity and long ſtanding in the Wars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> this did not quench any flame in the Enemy, for the <hi>Romans</hi> found them every way as eager in purſuit of theſe weak and fained Devices, as the greateſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Coat-Armour they could carry; for when in any skirmiſh Fortune made them Maſters thereof, they took as great Pride, as if they had ſubdued whole Armies, and bare them with as much Pomp and Triumph, as if they had got all <hi>Rome</hi> in ſubjection: which the wiſdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Nations looking into, it preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a cuſtom among all their Armies, that thence forth, no Foot Company or Chieftain of the Infantry ſhould carry in his Enſign any Coat-Armour or other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice what ever, more than the mixture, or true compoſition of two colours, together with the general Enſign of the Kingdom in the moſt eminent corner thereof. And after this time the <hi>Romans</hi> called their Enſign-bearers no more <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſignia,</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Original of Horſe and Horſe Colours.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HAving</hi> treated of the definition and ſignification of the ſeveral names which belong to the Enſignes of Foot, I will now take leave to ſpeak a little to the Colours or marks of Honour that are born on Horſeback; which I find by experienced Souldiers to be full as ancient or rather more than thoſe which belong to the Foot Companies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> omitting all prophane Opinions and vain circumſtances, I find when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed through the Red Sea, how they were purſued by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt, which did conſiſt moſt of Charriots (which in thoſe dayes were accounted Horſemen) and very properly too) becauſe being drawn by the violent force of Horſe, and laden with the ſtrongeſt and beſt experienced Souldiers, they had a double power to enter into Battalias to diſrank and break their array, and to make their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to run into a rout and confuſion; and though they had not the uſe of our Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, nor the true managing of the Horſe as we have, yet all their purpoſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the uſe of their Charriots, were to the ſame ends, to which at this day our Horſe are applyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> theſe Chariots belonged Colours, or Enſignes of Martial Honour; which were called Standards or Standarts, or the Kings Emperial Trophie: Indeed theſe were nothing ſo general, as thoſe on Foot, but more precious and reſerved, as an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute only belonging to the King and not to any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe</hi> Standards were charged with the Kings Emperial Coat-Armour, and uſually born by a Prince or ſome man of high place and dignity, the imitation whereof we ſtill purſue and follow at this day, giving it a ſuperiority above all other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After</hi> the uſe of Chariots was found out, the uſe of Elephants a warlike beaſt and of all other the ſtrongeſt; for theſe cerried cartain little artificial Houſes (in the form of Caſtles) on their backs in which were ſome few experienced Souldiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with warlike Enſignes, and weapons by which they overthrew the Foot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not</hi> long after the Exerciſe of Elephants, was found out the uſe of the ſingle Horſe, in thoſe Countries where Horſes were moſt frequent, as in <hi>Arabia, Parthia, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> for the <hi>Aſian</hi> parts; in <hi>Barbary, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> for the parts of <hi>Africa;</hi> and with us in <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia, Muſcovia, Poland, Hungary, Italie,</hi> but principally and above all the reſt in <hi>France,</hi> who were accounted in antient time the flower of warlike Horſemen, both in number and diſcipline; therefore from them hath been taken our Authority and examples: But now I conceive we may not go ſo far for either, referring for ſatisfaction to the preſent mode of Diſcipline in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for his Majeſties Horſe now in Command it is thought none can exceed them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have</hi> read of a <hi>Guydon</hi> uſed with the light Horſe in former times: Antiquity tells us of Gentlemen at Armes, Launciers and light Horſemen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the old Wars the Gentlemen at Armes belonged to the Kings own perſon, or in his abſence to his General only; And the Empreſa of honour that they followed was the Kings Standard Royall, being Damask and charged with his Coat-Armour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Launciers they had their Cornet to follow, which had Devices in them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their commanders pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> then the Light-horſ-men had their <hi>Guydon</hi> which was ſomewhat long and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42528:100"/> ſharp at the end but with a ſlit which made it double pointed much like to our late Dragooners; but for theſe Guydons I need not ſtand upon, only to ſhew all along there were Horſe Colours, as Enſignes of honour uſed. And now the Cornets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt in uſe with us in <hi>England,</hi> for the Horſe ſervice I need not decypher the length or breadth of them.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Dignitie of Enſigns.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>THe</hi> Dignitie and eſtimation of Enſignes in all ages hath been held moſt Venerable, and worthy; they have been eſteemed the glory of the Captain, and his company; and indeed they are no leſs, for where they periſh with diſgrace there the Captains honour faileth, and the Souldier's in hazzard of Ruine; for if the loſs proceed either from their Cowardice (or miſgovernment) it hath been death by the law of Armes to all that ſurvive; and the beſt mercy that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected is that every Souldier ſhall draw a lot for his life (file by file) ſo that one out of every file periſheth for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> next Dignitie of the Enſign is, that every Souldier as ſoon as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled and hath received either pay or impreſs, they antiently took a ſolemne Oath to be faithful to their Colours, to attend them carefully, and to defend them valiantly; And that upon all ſummons, of the Trumpet or Drum, or Command of their Officers, to repair to them, whereſoever they ſhall be lodged, ſtand, or be; and not to depart or ſtragle from them until they have received orders.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The</hi> Enſign hath another dignity, that whenſoever he ſhall enter into City, Town, Garriſon, Campe, or other Randeſvouze of aboad, he is to be firſt lodged, before any other Officer or Souldier; And not in any mean place, but the beſt and moſt ſpacious for the drawng up of the Souldiers upon any Alarme; and his Quarter ought to be the moſt ſecure from danger.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The</hi> Enſign hath Dignity of place according to the Antiquity of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> But in one particular caſe, it hath been judged to be greater than his Captain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> lendeth place to him; as thus, no Captain can receive his antiquity from his inroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but from the firſt hour in which his Colours flew; for if two be inrolled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one day, and the latter marcheth before the face of his Enemy with his Colours flying, in this caſe the firſt hath loſt his priority, and the latter for ever after ſhall preceed him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have</hi> read of another reſolve; Three Captains (or more as occaſion happeneth) were all inrolled upon a day, and all their Colours flying; preſently upon a Truce, Compoſition or other occaſion there is ſome ſmall ceſſation of Armes, and theſe new inrolled Captains are Caſheer'd (or diſmiſt) for the preſent ſervice: Now the two firſt that had priority of place not only by inrollment but by flying of their Enſignes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be out of action (to a Souldier the taſt of gain is pleaſant) took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Commands as Lieutenants of two Colonels Companies <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Captains places in courteſie, retaining thoſe titles, and in ſome Courts of War have had their Voyces; Now the third all this time taketh upon him no place, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in <hi>Statu quo prius;</hi> And in revolution of time all theſe three Captains afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid are again Commiſſionated for three new Companies of their own, the Queſtion was whoſe Enſigne ſhould fly firſt, and which of theſe three ſhall have the priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of place? It was thus anſwered and adjudged by the old Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Vere,</hi> &amp;c. that the two firſt who had taken upon them Lieutenancies had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt their Superiorities, and the third whoſe Honour ſlept, but dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42528:100"/> not, had precedencie of place, and his Enſign flew before the other ever after.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The</hi> Enſigne hath this Dignity to have a Guard ever about it, which no other Officer hath; neither is it to be diſimbogued, or unlodged, without a ſpecial Guard, attending upon it both of Muſquetteers and Pikes; (And ſo for a Cornet with his own Squadron of Horſe.) Alſo in the field if it be in particular Diſcipline or otherwiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Alt, or ſtand, at ſuch time as the Army or Company are to refreſh themſelves with victuals or other reſt, in this caſe the Enſigne ſhall by no means lay his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours upon the ground, or put them in unworthy or baſe hands, but he ſhall firſt furle and fold them up and ſet the butt end on the ground ſupported with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants Holbearts, and the Enſign himſelf ſhall not go from the view thereof, unleſs he ſhall leave a ſufficient guard for them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>An</hi> other dignity of an Enſign is, If a Noblemen or an Eſquire will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Command of a private Company and have no other ſuperiour place in an Army, and a mean Gentleman hath the like equal Command but a great deal more antient, although there ought to be a reſpect if they ſhould happen in company unto the worth and quality of the perſon; yet the meaner Gentlemans Colours ſhall fly before the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> this hath been the antient practiſe in the Wars, how then do thoſe Captains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe themſelves, and their Enſigns, to ſuffer young Captains to ſtep in, (either by greatneſs in quality or favour) to fly their Colours before them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Every</hi> Enſign hath his Dignity, although he is wholly to be at the Captains Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet in juſtice no Captain, nor other Officer can command the Enſign-bearer from his Colours, for they are as man and wife, and ought not to indure a ſeparation; nor can he be commanded with his Enſign to any baſe (diſhonourable) place or Action: And hence it is that to this day this place, and mark of Honour is held in ſuch a venerable &amp; worthy eſtimation amongſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> that they will not allow of any ſecond between him and the Captain, as the name of a Lieutenant to be amongſt them, thinking it to be a ſuperfluous charge and command, becauſe it is in their judgments a leſſening and a bateing of the Enſignes Honour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> in this although we eſteem an Enſign very honourable, we in <hi>England</hi> differ from them, owning the place of a Lieutenant to be honourable and neceſſary, who ought to be a man of moſt approved experience; for he takes from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe heavy burdens, which otherwiſe would make the Captains trouble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, nor can the Enſign diſcharge them unleſs he neglects his care and duty to his Colours.</p>

                     <p n="2">
                        <q>2. Not to bear one black ſpot and no more in his Enſign, for it ſheweth ſome blemiſh in the owner, if the ſpot be round, ſquare, or of equal proportion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <q>3. If the ſpot be unequal, it ſignifieth a Funeral or deadly revenge.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <q>4. Not to carry words in his Colours without a Device; nor a Device without words; but Device with words, and the words not to exceed four in number, for if there be more it ſheweth imperfection.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <q>5. Not to carry more Colours than two; except it be for ſome ſpecial note, or the Enſign of ſeveral Kingdoms, it is a Surcharge and eſteemed folly.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Having</hi> ſhewed the true Colours, and the diſgraces that may ariſe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of them, as mentioned by Mr. <hi>Markham,</hi> I come to the next diſgraces which proceed from <hi>Negligence in Government;</hi> as in carrying his Colours furl'd (or folded) up when they ſhould be flying, or to let his Colours fly, when they ſhould be folded up; or to diſplay (or flouriſh them) when they ſhould be carried without
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42528:101"/> any hand motion; or to carry them without motion when they ſhould be diſplayed; or to vaile them when they ſhould be advanced, or to advance them when they ſhould be vailed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> lodge or diſlodge Colours without a Guard; or to ſuffer any man to handle them that hath not a lawful authority. Now the avoydance hereof is ſufficient to keep any man from groſs errors.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The</hi> laſt diſgrace as to the dignity of the Enſign is</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the raſhneſs and unadviſedneſs of Actions; when he is in ſafety out of a phantaſtical bravado to thruſt himſelf into danger; as to charge the Enemy when he ſhould ſtand ſtill: It is not only a diſgrace; but the offence hath been adjudged worthy of death, although he may obtain victory by that forward action.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>If</hi> in a March, Battalia, or ſetting of the Parade, or upon any other Military imployments, he ſhall miſplace himſelf, it is a diſgrace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>If</hi> in a battel, skirmiſh, or fight where the Enſign is put to retreit, his Colours ſhall be ſurled (or folded) up, or ſhouldred and not flying and held forth and extended with the left arm, and his Sword advanced in his right hand, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are diſgraced and ſuch retreit is baſe and unworthy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>If</hi> the Enſign-Bearer ſhall happen either in battel or skirmiſh to be ſlain, and ſo the Colours fall to the ground, if thoſe, or ſome of them next adjoyning threreunto do not recover and advance them up, it is not only a diſgrace to the Enſign, but an utter diſhonour to the whole Company; as I have declared, that if the Colours be loſt, there muſt be a ſevere accompt given for them: And indeed a greater act of Cowardice cannot be found, than to ſuffer the Colours to be loſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There</hi> is an antient preſident, but freſh in memory, that in great defeats when Armies have been overthrown, ſcattered and diſperſed ſo that particular ſafety hath made men forget general obſervations; even then, the Enſign being wounded to death, and deſperate of all relief, hath ſtript his Enſign from the ſtaff and wrapt or folded it about his body, and ſo periſhed with it: This Enſign cannot be ſaid to be loſt, becauſe the honour thereof was carried with his freed Soul into Heaven, to the poſſeſſion of the eternal fort for ever: Now in this particular the Enemy cannot boaſt of any Triumph if then purchaſed, more than every Sexton may do when he robs the dead of his winding ſheet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> it hath been reported that <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> dyed at the battel of <hi>Alcazar:</hi> And I have read of many of our brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> that thus dyed at the renowned Battel at <hi>Newport,</hi> and have heard that many have ſo done in the Army of our late So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of ever bleſſed memory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>And laſtly,</hi> If any man ſhall recover the loſt Enſign and bring it away flying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no matter how low in condition the man is, if the Captain upon any after conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations beſtow thoſe Colours upon ſome other man; it is a diſgrace both to the Captain and his Enſign, for he doth injury to Vertue and diſcourage Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome may object that upon compoſition with the party deſerving, the Captain may diſpoſe of his Colours where he pleaſeth: I confeſs it true, but if this compoſition be forced it is injurious; And if it come by a voluntary conſent of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is baſe and moſt unworthy in him alſo.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the right uſe and ordering of the Enſign or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; with the Poſtures and Flouriſhes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>AS</hi> to my beſt Remembrance, I have given you a Catalogue of the Diſgraces, ſo I ſhall here inſert as to my knowledge the true uſe of the Enſign, whereby thoſe injuries may be avoyded.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>And</hi> firſt, you ſhall underſtand that in all extended Marches (and not drawn into a Body) as when they march either into a Friends or Enemies Country; or otherwiſe are conducted to ſome remote Randeſvouz; here the Enſign (or Colours) ought to be half furl'd (or folded) up, and half flying, ſhall be ſhouldred and born a little croſs the Enſign-bearers neck, with his hand extended a good diſtance from his body, and his left hand upon his ſide or hilt of his ſword; this is termed a marching in State.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>If</hi> he ſhall enter into any City or great Town; then he ſhall unfold or open his Colours, and let them fly at full length, and carry them in his right hand cloſe under the hoſe, with a lofty hand and extended arm: This is a marching in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; but if the wind blow ſtiff, or there is a weakneſs or weariſomneſs in the Enſign-bearer, then he may ſet the butt end againſt his waſte and not otherwiſe; and is to have but one hand upon his ſtaff in any march whatever.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>In</hi> all Troopings the Enſign ſhall ever be furl'd and carried in the ſame Poſtures as the Pikes ought to be.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>When</hi> the Company is drawn up into a Body, the Colours muſt be flying; and by the Way, in caſe the General or ſupreme of the Wars, or any Noble Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger worthy of reſpect, do come, immediately upon his or their approach, the Enſign-bearer in all humility is to bow the head of his Colours, waving them with the bow of his body, and to raiſe both it and himſelf up again: And as the ſaid perſon ſhall paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Drum ſhall beat, and the Colours ſhall be diſplayed: This alſo the Enſign ſhall do in all Marchings, or other motions of Civil Exerciſes, where your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours paſs by you, or you by them: Nay it is expedient and fit ſo to be done to any Gentleman, that is your familiar; for it is no more but as the vailing of your hat, or giving your friend a courteſie.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Now</hi> when the Body is drawn up into <hi>Battalia</hi> and the Enemy within view thereof, then every man being in his place is to expreſs all the Gallantry he can, and eſpecially the Enſign-bearer either in diſplaying his Colours <hi>ſtanding, marching, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and retreiting</hi> (or <hi>retiring;</hi>) and all theſe ought not to be done at one time, but when the bodies are joyning, and they muſt be done with great reſpect, for to uſe the Poſtures directly to the motion or ſtanding of the Body; and not to do as I have ſeen ſome in ordinary <hi>Militia Diſcipline,</hi> that have but one or two motions of their Colours, upon and for all occaſions; as if true Honour had ſuch weak inventions; this without doubt is moſt baſe and unworthy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To proceed to the Poſtures of the Enſign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They</hi> are in general as followeth, ſo well as I can expreſs them; for they are better in execution, and to be taught by example, than any pen can deſcribe them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To</hi> change them with a plain wave from hand to hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To</hi> change them with lofty turns from hand to hand; each hand performing their turns before you deliver them, as from the right to the left, and from the left to the right, as at firſt,</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42528:102"/>3. <hi>From</hi> the right hand with a wave and lofty turn jutting the Colours upon the left ſhoulder, and raiſing up with the ſame hand again, and with lofty turns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it into the left hand, that ſo thereby you may execute the ſame upon the right ſhoulder, and after the turns, to deliver it into the right hand, as at firſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>With</hi> (and from) the right hand with lofty turns throw your Colours under the left arm, recovering them ſpeedily back with conceived Floriſhes, you deliver them into the left hand: you may execute the ſame with the left hand.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>With</hi> turns or flouriſhes you bring the butt end of the ſtaff to your left hand turning the palm of your left hand outwards (but not for the reception of it) and with the ſame hand only throw it off upon its turn with a flouriſh to deliver it into the left hand, and to perform the ſame with the left hand, and deliver the Colours into the right hand, as at firſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>With</hi> lofty turns bring the Colours over the head down right (but not too low) before, and raiſing it again, with the fore-turn and back-turn over the head, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hands and delivering as before.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>From</hi> the right hand deliver into your left hand with the palm of your hand, uppermoſt, the butt end of your ſtaff turning it backwards upon the left ſhoulder; and turning it over the head with the ſame hand, you deliver it into the right hand after the ſame manner, which being performed with the right hand you proceed to the next.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>From</hi> the right hand with lofty turns, fore-turns and back-turns, you deliver your ſtaff into your left hind, and wheel it with the ſame hand on the ſame ſide, and after your recovery to deliver it into the right hand, performing of the ſame and proceed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>From</hi> the right hand upon the left ſhoulder, raiſing it and turning with its back-turn into the neck; with its returns and lofty floriſhes over the head you deliver the Colours into the left, and with the left hand upon the right ſhoulder you execute the ſame, delivering them into your right hand as at firſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>'Tis</hi> by ſome termed the Figure of eighth; that is with the right hand the half wheel on the left ſide, and ſo back on the right ſide, and then delivering it into the left hand to perform the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>To turn</hi> it round the head oftentimes upon the palm with your fingers of your right hand, ſo recovering it, with lofty floriſhes you deliver it into your left hand to perform the ſame, and ſo delivering of them into the right hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> if it be your pleaſure to be compleat in the Exerciſe of them, you go back to the tenth, and ſo conclude with the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> in your concluſion I have ſeen ſome to furl them up as they diſplay them, and ſo to open them again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> to furl them up in the field it is moſt ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Others</hi> there are that I have ſeen to round them oftentimes about their middles, but I cannot juſtifie it upon any <hi>Military</hi> account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Others</hi> I have ſeen, that thinking to diſplay their Colours bravely delivered them from hand to hand under leg; I muſt boldly inform ſuch as uſe it, that 'tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement to the Captains Colours, and an unworthy Act in the performers of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I told</hi> you of ſome particular Poſtures and proper for the Enſign-bearer to obſerve.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Standing,</hi> when the Body ſtands, you are to diſplay the Colours, to and fro in a direct circle, and changing from hand to hand, and no more, without you are commanded to ſhew the excellency of your parts; but be ſure to be well guarded when you ſhall be ſo commanded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>In marching,</hi> the Poſture is to diſplay the Colours with the right hand only, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enſign ſtill forwards, waving it cloſe over and by the right ſhoulder, never croſſing the Body, but ſtill keeping it flying on the out-ſide of the right ſhoulder.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The charging Poſture is</hi> to carry the ſtaff extended ſtreight forward before your body, waving it to and fro as high as your boſome, being ready to give the aſſiſtance or aid with the left hand for the preſervation of your Colours, or to offend the Enemy if occaſion require.</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42528:103"/>

                           <p>By the way you may obſerve: whereas the Serjants of every company are to be aſſiſtant to the Serjant-Major of that particular Regiment for the dividing of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Corporalſhips or ſquadrons, files or half files, for the making up of any body, form or figure according to directions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So the Serjant-Majors of Regiments, are to aſſiſt the Serjant-Major of an Army, to bring in what diviſions or bodies ſoever ſhall be called for; and the Serjant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General is ſo to do to the Martial of the Field: And that his duty may be performed with all careful ſeverity, the Serjant-Major is allowed his Hakney to ſpeed it from Company to Company, to ſee that every Company be in his true form; and not to ſuffer any man whatever through Pride, Stubborneſs, Neglect, Covetouſneſs of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or by any other dilitory, and weak excuſe, to break out of his rank, or to diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion any part of the body, by any rude or uncomely poſture, but ſeverely to rebuke the ſame, and compel a ſpeedy reformation.</p>
                           <p>But out of an Army, both in field or otherwiſe, then the office both of a Serjant-Major and Marſhal ſhall be in himſelf; he ſhall ſummon Courts of War, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Captains, to proceed to trial againſt offenders, he ſhall proportion all allodgments, encampings, and with his beſt skill fortifie the ſame; and ſhall upon fight draw the battel (yet with this limitation, to take directions from his ſuperior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>And as you ſee he is to take care of all Watches and Guards about that Regiment: ſo if there be no greater Officer than himſelf, there to give the word, and to appoint the Court of guard and Sentinels; but if there be a ſuperior Officer, then the Serjant-Major ſhall receive it from him, and ſo give it to the Captains and other ſuch inferior Officers as ſhall have the guard that night.</p>
                           <p>In ſhort, a Serjant-Major ought to be dutiful to all his Superiours by whom he is to be directed: he ought to be an experienced Souldier, and of a valiant and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted behaviour.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is familiar and common amongſt men to be diverſe and contrarie in opinion; eſpecially in every doubtful and queſtionable matter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old ſaying, <hi>ſo many men ſo many minds:</hi> every man muſt therefore prepare himſelf with a good and equal contentedneſs to endure what others do cenſure and judge of his poſition, as either their reaſon ſhall lead them or their ſenſe and humour carry them. Neither ought any man challenge greater prerogative to his opinion than he bringeth with him authority of reaſon for the ſame: And ſeeing that reaſon, joyned with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is the only guide to direct us in all affaires of Action, whereunto all our opinions and judgments muſt be reſtrained, we muſt ſubmit our private conceipts to be ruled by reaſon and experience. In things of great importance and weight, as it behoveth us to be very conſiderate, before we reſolve and ſet down a certainty which we intend to purſue; ſo in this matter of War, are ſome points ſo difficult as may miniſter occaſion and queſtion of long debate, unleſs thoſe controverſies be commended to men of ſtayed and approved Judgment, who are not carried away with corrupt and common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but adviſed and perſwaded by the greater ſtrength of reaſon, confirmed by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and preſidents of the like examples: And by the way give me leave to declare my opinion, that no man can ſet down in writing a rule or method, preciſely to be obſerved in War, the ſame being rather to be printed by a long practice and experience in a Souldiers breaſt, to be executed, as time, matter and place may miniſter, that upon the accident of any (in which there may be then required a new form and order to be uſed accordingly) It is held for a maxime That a Prince cannot any way more dangerouſly hazard his Realm and Country, than by giving an Invader Battel at his firſt landing, as hath been heretofore an uſual cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>And ſince it is amongſt things of the greateſt importance that may concern a Prince and his kingdom, a people, their liberty and goods, it is to be conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

                  <p>But becauſe there are other opinions, the reaſons of each opinion ſhall be ſet down, and then a reſolve with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments ſhall follow.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The greater fury, the leſſer reaſon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſuppreſſed in an Army, as a breach of Order, and not to be inflamed.</note> The fury of the Countrey upon the firſt firing of the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons is great; every man <hi>(pro aris &amp; focis)</hi> violently running down to the Sea ſide, to repel the diſordered Enemy at the firſt confuſed landing; which fury, if ſuffered to grow cold, we ſhall not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflame again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> While the Enemy is landing,<note place="margin">He is a ſilly Invader that upon a difficulty will make a retreit.</note> if he find any difficulty or danger (being in boats) they are ready to retire to their ſhips a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: But if they be once landed with their Artillery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is not then poſſible for them to retire to their Ships again, without extream danger of their lives upon the retreit, and the diſhonourable loſs of their Munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſity compelling them to fight, and all hope of eſcape by flight being then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them, they become ten times more dangerous Enemies to deal withall than before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Every man knoweth what great advantage they have,<note place="margin">It is no great difficulty to land men both ſtrongly and orderly.</note> that have a firm footing on land, to encounter an Enemy that muſt land out of boats, in confuſed ſtragling manner, and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſpeedily will go to enjoy the benefit of this advantage; whereas, if we ſuffer the Enemy to land, and put himſelf in Military order, he becometh more terrible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>

                        <hi>Some</hi> others hold this old cuſtome of running to the Sea ſide to be but a barbarous cuſtome, void of Order, and Warlike Diſcipline, very perillous to our ſelves, not hurtful to the Enemy, but rather a means to loſe all; and therefore wiſh by ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that order of repair to the Sea ſide be reſtrained and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſuffered to land quietly:<note place="margin">Suffered to land quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Enemy would land whether you would or no.</note> and in the mean time to drive and carry away all Cattel, Victuals, Forrage, Carriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and certain places of Randeſvouze appointed, (ſome diſtance from the Sea ſide) from whence they may march in a Warlike manner and Order; and ſo by carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

                     <head>The Reaſons of the Second Opinion.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is ſaid the invading Enemy bringeth a ſelect Company of Diſciplin'd and well train'd Souldiers whom we ſeek to encounter with a confuſed multitude of men untrain'd, in which match there is no compariſon, but loſs certain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is ſaid an Enemy of force meaning to land will do it in deſpight of us, and then the Countrey offering to repel them, and finding themſelves not able, grow much more fearful, than if quietly without reſiſtance we had ſuffered the Enemy to land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where we ſuffer the Enemy to land we may drive away all proviſion and Cattel further into the Countrey, and then maintain ſtreights and paſſages well fenced and fortified; ſo as the Enemy ſhall be enforced to approach us upon our own ſtrengths and fortifications to his great peril and danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They ſay, in this manner we keeping Victuals from him by land, and his Majeſties Navy alſo in the mean time keeping the Seas, the Enemy for want of Victuals only ſhall be forced to retire, and glad to withdraw himſelf if he can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Further,</hi> It is alledged how doubtful a thing Battel is, and how dangerous a thing for a King to commit his Crown upon it, and therefore is that temporizing courſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Next becauſe it is Impoſſible ſo to man the Sea coaſt round, as that an Enemy (meaning to land and burn only) might be prevented, for that he will make ſhew to land in one place, and (the Country being drawn down thither) may ſuddenly weigh Anchor and Saile further in few hours, than your Army that you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in a readineſs, can march well in two dayes.</p>
                     <p>As for example,<note place="margin">How your prepared forces may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</note> The <hi>French</hi> made a ſhew in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's days as though they would Land in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> or <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> &amp; finding the Country drawn down thither by means of the Kings being there, hoyſed Sayles, landed &amp; burnt at <hi>Brighthmeſteed</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> &amp; in the Downs in <hi>Kent,</hi> and after returned and landed in the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> Then ſeeing the Enemies remove from place to place, is ſo ſpeedy, and his landing place ſo uncertain, and the knowledge thereof before hand impoſſible; I would fain know how ſtrong a reſiſtance the Country can be able to make upon the ſudden, againſt an Invadour, that will land a thouſand or two, at one inſtant, or rather which hath imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued his men inveſſels of ſo ſmall draught, as the men may leap a ſhoar out of them.</p>
                     <p>The Opponent meaning to ſail ſafely betwixt the two Rocks of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> imagineth he goes clear when as he ſtriketh upon both; who ſeeing to diſlike of giving Battel, would have the Country drawn down to make reſiſtance and impeach their landing. I would thereupon ask this queſtion; if the men you ſend down be once in fight, whether you think it not requiſite to ſecond them, and if you ſecond them, what do you elſe, but ingage your ſelf to Battel; if you will not ſecond them, then do you moſt barbarouſly expoſe your men to the ſlaughter and butchery of your Enemy: How great a diſcouragement that would be to your people, and what inconvenience might follow, I leave to your Judgement to conſider.</p>
                     <p>But from whence proceedeth this opinion of the neceſſity or convenience of a raſh and ſuddain incounter with an Enemy at his landing, but from an exceſſive fear and doubtfulneſs conceived beforehand that all the Realm ſhould be in hazzard to be loſt, if the Enemy were but once ſuffered to land, and have firm footing. Which ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination groweth for want of skill and judgment in Martial actions, and therefore we ſeek to prevent that by a deſperate and diſorderly fight, which we might more ſafely remedy by a defenſive, and leſs dangerous courſe, as may appear by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of a weak Ship, and a battered Town; which both by ſuffering themſelves to be entered and aſſaulted, the one by her cloſe fights, the other by new intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do give the entered Enemy the greater foyle, even then when they think themſelves poſſeſt of all.</p>
                     <p>Beſides a King that is in his own Country may be ſupplied with infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Pioniers, who in few hours may rear earth works to triple his force againſt an Invadour (as is well known to him that is a Souldier) whereof he ſhould be utterly deprived, by that moſt barbarous cuſtome heretofore uſed and yet maintained; I mean of that diſorderly running down to the Sea ſide, to give an Invading Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my battel, at his firſt landing.</p>
                     <p>What reaſon had <hi>Spain</hi> to attempt the Conqueſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this Realm, but that they preſumed,<note place="margin">The only hope of an invador is to prevaile by Battel.</note> we would aſſuredly rely upon our old Cuſtom of giving them Battel at their landing: which if we ſhould do, there would be great likelihood;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42528:110"/> firſt that we ſhould loſe the ſame, and next having loſt the Battel, I fear that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this famous Iſland would enſue. For an aſpiring King that hath a great faction within a Contry may preſume beforehand to carry the ſame, if he be aſſured, that the people thereof will give him battel at his firſt landing. Therfore if you will avoid an Invaſion and the danger of a Conqueſt, let it be known to the world that it is an error, whereby you might imbrace thoſe advantages, and the benefit that our Country affords, and you ſhall undoubtedly avoid the trouble of the firſt, and be free from the danger of the laſt.<note place="margin">Scanderbegg <hi>againſt the</hi> Turk.</note> We read that <hi>Scanderbegge</hi> (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theleſs that he expected the Invaſion of ſo puiſſant an Enemy, as was the <hi>Turk</hi>) thought it not good to leave any great Army of Force to give him Battel; but only certain ſelect bands (or Companies of Foot) with Troops of Horſe, &amp; the foot too lightly armed, &amp; cauſing all the frontiers to withdraw themſelves, their Cattel, Corn and Subſtance into the ſtrong and fortyfied places of the Country; did with ſuch ſelect forces face the Enemy on the frontiers, by keeping of ſtreights &amp; paſſages, making ſuddain attempts in the night, &amp; ſuch other times as by Spies he found the Enemy careleſs, and ſo with a few people (or ſmall force) by time, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and expences he wearied the Enemy and cauſed him to retire, that otherwiſe in Battel might have gotten the victory, and ſo in ſhort time commanded the whole Country. Wherefore I would not wiſh any Prince to adventure his Kingdom that way, unleſs he be weary of the ſame Battel being the only thing for an Invadour to ſeek; and on the contrary for the invaded to avoid and ſhun, for the one doth hazzard but his people, and hath a lot to win a Kingdom, and the other in loſing of the Battel endangereth his Crown.</p>
                     <p>The Opponent diſalloweth of a confuſed diſorderly running down to the Sea ſide, and yet would fight with them in their landing, which is a thing impoſſible. For if you tarry time to put men in order, (which you muſt of neceſſity do by reaſon of the Countries ſlack aſſembly) then will the Enemy land in the mean time and fruſtrate your purpoſe, unleſs you were made acquainted long beforehand, when and where he intended to land, and where you may make your ſuppoſed Trenches you have declared, to lodge your men in. There be ſome alſo that conceive a great advantage of the Enemies weakneſs coming from the Sea, and of their landing out of Boates diſorderly, which when it ſhall happen to come to trial, it will eaſily appear how far they are deceived of both: for who knoweth not that even all men coming near the ſhore, and ſmelling land, become well and ſound again of their Sea ſickneſs. Alſo, what numbers of men will be landed at one inſtant in Boats, Gallies and other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of ſmall draught, and that ſafe enough, thoſe that have been imployed in like actions, can teſtifie. And as touching Rocks, Shelves, contrary Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſaid may fight for us, we muſt not build upon ſuch uncertainties, for an Enemy will beforehand ſo ſet down, and lay his plot, where he will make his deſcent, as that none of all thoſe accidents ſhall give any impedement to the ſame. What other advantages our Country men may have either of their Courage, or goodneſs of their cauſe,<note place="margin">Strength and courage availeth much being joyned with skill and order to diſpoſe of them.</note> without knowledge, and order, how to diſpoſe thereof, will rather be an occaſion of their overthrow, than means of the Victory. But eſpecially a few to fight againſt many, diſordered againſt ordered, Countrey men againſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Souldiers; the odds that the Enemy hath of you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will be much greater than your imagined advantages. And albeit that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, our Country men have a ſhew of deſire to fight, (as having as great, natural help of ſtrength, courage and ability as any other Nation) yet can it not be denied, but that in the Artificial we muſt needs be defective, for want of uſe and Practice, therefore not to be ſuffered to run down to the Sea ſide, in that confuſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner unleſs it might be done with a compleat number of choyce men; conducted by a skilful leader that knoweth how to make his fight upon the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vantages, and to retire them orderly again to their leaſt hurt and diſcouragement; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwſe I do altogether diſallow, of that general repair to the Sea ſide. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make your aſſemblies five or ſix miles diſtant with all your Foot forces, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42528:110"/> to attend them in the plaines, with your Horſe; for whatſoever men reſolve with themſelves before hand, and what minds ſoever they may ſeem to put on, when they ſhall be driven to make their wayes through the vollies of ſhot, having never been acquainted with the game before, it may either make them pinch courteſie through the ſtrangeneſs thereof, or at leaſt having taſted of that ſauce (and finding it bitter) may ſpread rumours to diſcourage a whole Army; for oftentimes the ſame and bruite of a repulſe maketh others as fearful that but hear of it, as thoſe that have been in the Action and born the blows themſelves. How unlikely then it is, that you ſhould profit your ſelves by that means or impeach your Enemy, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>But let us come to examples, for it is not ſufficient to ſay by experience of former invaſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not alledging any.

Infinite are the examples to confirme theſe temporizing courſes, by meanes whereof great and huge Armies have in a ſhort time been diſſolved and come to nothing.

                     <p>Laſtly, The better to remove this old impreſſion of raſh encountring of an Enemy Invador, remember the unadviſed encounter of the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie</hi> who beſieged a certain Town in the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> fall.</note> called <hi>Granſon,</hi> with a very great Army, to the relief whereof came certain <hi>Switzers,</hi> (though not great in number;) the Duke hearing of their approach, ſent ſome forces to them to give them all annoyance poſſible, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to prevent their entrie and deſcent into the Country (for the paſſage they ſhould enter by was through a certain narrow ſtraight betwixt certain Mountains) and himſelf followed with ſome greater forces to ſecond them. And this was done by the Duke, contrary to the advice of his counſel who perſwaded him, rather to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their coming with all his forces in the place where they were; for the place both by Nature and alſo by Art was ſtrongly enramped, and it was ſo that in all reaſon he could ſuſtain no danger. To make it ſhort, the Dukes Van-guard was not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Swittzers</hi> entrry, but retired; the Dukes rere-guard ſeeing this, ſuppoſing they had fled began alſo to fly; in fine his whole Army retired toward the Camp, although ſome behaved theſelves very well in this retreit, yet when they came into the Camp they durſt not defend it; but all betook themſelves to flight, leaving their rich and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Camp and their Artillery to the ſpoyl of the poor <hi>Swittzers,</hi> who ſlew but very few of his people for want of horſemen to follow the chaſe. The Duke, who the day before was lifted up to the skies in pride, through the ſeeking to himſelf ſo many great States and Princes, that deſired to allie and confederate themſelves with him in league and freindſhip, preſently after the loſs of this Battel found a great deal of alteration and change, for there fell from him four ſorts of people, who became his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42528:112"/> Enemies. The rage of the Duke was ſtill ſo great that he would not thus give over, but would trie a ſecond Battel at <hi>Morat:</hi> Upon the loſs whereof divers others of his Allies fell from him alſo. And laſtly after the Battel of <hi>Nanſey</hi> where he himſelf was ſlain, a great part both of his own proper Dominions, and of <hi>Burgundie</hi> it ſelf, fell from his houſe alſo. Thus you may ſee what a long and evil tail a loſt Battel hath; as <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King was wont to ſay. If you deſire examples of greater Antiquity, you are referred to the reading of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories; but becauſe brevity is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I will remember you only of this one; Namely of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who never could attain to the ſole government of <hi>Rome,</hi> until <hi>Pompey</hi> (oppoſing himſelf againſt it, on the behalf of the State and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi>) gave him Battel and loſt it: after which he was driven to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the King ſent his head unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there were left none able to withſtand. By the which he got not only the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute government for himſelf, but alſo brought and reduced the free State of <hi>Rome</hi> to a <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the defendant chance to win the Battel, then indeed he removeth the cauſe and endeth the danger. As the <hi>Moors</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Moors</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
                        </note> who landed without any reſiſtance: But the defendants finding themſelves the ſtronger as well in Foot as in Horſe, thought it no danger to give Battel, which grew by temporizing, untill their power was come together: for it is moſt certain, that as long as you abſtain from coming to fight, the Enemies ſhall alwaies be held in doubt of winning, and you ſhall be in no hazard of loſing the Country, and your male-contents and evil diſpoſed perſons will be kept from revolt, who no doubt will ſee a Battel fought before they will ſhew themſelves open Enemies; yea, whatſoever they had promiſed beforehand, as the <hi>Portugals</hi> did to <hi>Don Antony,</hi> and performed it not. By which dilatory manner of proceeding, you may be at choice either to accept or refuſe the Battel, as ſhall be moſt for your advantage, when by time you have made your ſelves ſtrong and your Enemies weak. And this defenſive War, and theſe temporizing courſes, we ſee that all Princes and men of War that are, or have been of late of Judgment do imitate and follow. As whoſoever will Look into the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s actions ſhall ſeldom ſee that ever he came to fight a ſet battel, but when all other meanes did fail to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that which he intended. And no leſs noble and glorious is that victory holden, which is obtained by Counſel, device and policy, than that which is won by the ſword, violence and Blood.</p>
                     <p>I have now anſwered to the queſtion firſt propoſed. &amp; given the reaſons on both ſides, leaving my ſuperiors to their better judgements. Although the people of this Nation heretofore ran headlong upon the invador to the Sea ſide, without ſufficient armes, advice or command; ſuch furious actions the diſcreet Souldier is againſt. But in theſe our later dayes the people being more civilized, better armed and diſciplined; and the whole Nation in a better poſture of defence;<note place="margin">If any advantage is offered not to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize.</note> it may now be granted that in ſome caſes, to defer and delay your fight may be dangerous, as in letting ſlip ſome notable advantage; from which you are not reſtrained but only to be adviſed in this caſe, not to joyn Battel raſhly and unadviſedly with the Enemy. The which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the danger of raſh attempts) doth cut you off from advantages and ſupplies, that may be had, by time, deliberation, and counſel; for their is nothing in which true fortitude may be ſhewed more than in this action: for to fight, courage doth not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally provoke; but to refrain upon good cauſe, is the advice of wiſdome; and he that will fight upon every call of the Enemy when offered, ſhall be ſure to do it to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and thereby ſhall ſhew that he hath no experience of Wars, and is ignorant of the chances and mutability of fortune, or as I may ſay more aptly, knoweth not how to uſe his fortune: yet what is the common voice of the Country? which heat and fury as it riſeth ſuddainly, ſo may it be cooled quickly again. But that which increaſeth and confirmeth courage beſt and maketh men reſolute and conſtant indeed, is when they ſhall ſee themſelves accompanied with numbers able to reſiſt, inſtructed with knowledge how to uſe their armes and weapons, and fortified with order to be able to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42528:113"/> withſtand and repel an Enemy: This is it, which will make a coward valiant: For as one ſaith, the fierce and diſordered men, are much weaker than the fearful and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for that order expelleth fear from men, and in the end diſorder abateth fierceneſs; ſo then it is not fury that prevaileth in War, but good diſcipline and order.</p>
                     <p>The chief ſcope is to perſwade a reſtraint of the violent and diſorderly running down of the Country to the Sea ſide to fight and give Battel to the Enemy at his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the old cuſtome, ſhewing the danger and inconvenience that may follow. And for the other part it is granted by all that it is perilous for a defendant Prince to hazzard his Crown at a Battel; and more dangerous for men untrained to encounter expert diſciplin'd Souldiers. Put the caſe that Battel be given, and loſs received; then if we have no ſtrong Towns adjacent to give the Enemy ſtop, to make head and rally again, it will prove moſt perilous to us. Therefore moderately it may be concluded dangerous (unleſs advantage might be obtain'd) for any Prince to give an invading Enemy Battel.</p>
                     <p>And here by the way (occaſion being offered) to ſpeak of ſtrong Towns; ſome there be of that opinion that a Country well peopled, that hath no, or few ſtrong Towns, is in leſs danger of conqueſt than that Realm that hath many: becauſe (ſay they) an Enemy cannot any way neſtle himſelf, but that you may at all times force him to Battel at your pleaſure. To that may be anſwered that a Battel being the thing that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadour is moſt deſirous of, and which a defendant ought to ſhun; your ſtrong Towns in that caſe are moſt available for the defendant Prince in his own Country againſt an Invador; becauſe he may onely with one ſtrong Town weary an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours Army and conſume it: eſpecially if he be but able with a ſmall force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp near his Town beſieged: for the Invador is thereby reſtrained from aſſaulting the ſame, for fear the defendants Camp ſhould aſſail him in the mean time. The which worketh all for the defendant, in winning of time to the weakning and ruin of his Enemies Army: the date whereof (as by daily experience is found) is not above twelve or thirteen weeks continuance; ſo as your ſtrong Towns avail wholly for the defendant;<note place="margin">In our late Wars.</note> and are dangerous only in <hi>Civil and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Wars,</hi> for that ſuch Towns revolting work the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect againſt their Lord and Maſter, as they did before for him: for examples &amp; preſidents of this, you may behold what the ſtrong holds of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and England it ſelf did againſt their Lords and Soveraignes: Inſomuch as we may truly ſay of them <hi>They are a dangerous good:</hi> Wherefore I think it matter of Joy to all loyal hearts that our moſt Gracious Soveraign hath a Kingdom ſo well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a warlike people, whereby to be enabled at all times to front and give a ſtop to an Enemy Invadour: And as touching a rebellious number, I hope we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt or fear them, as long as they ſhall want skillful leaders and Governours to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them; pay, armour, Munition, and other neceſſaries to uphold them; wherewith His now moſt Royal Majeſty is plentifully furniſhed; the want whereof ſhall force Rebels in a few dayes to diſperſe themſelves, who being once broken may preſently be followed in groſs; in ſuch ſort as they ſhall never be able to aſſemble and make head again. And what leader of skill and judgement will undertake ſuch an enterprize in theſe dayes; and not forecaſt that a power and force aſſembled cannot long ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rich and ſtrong Towns to ſupply their wants; or at leaſtwiſe, without ſo much as is requiſite to retain and keep an Army together in due order and obedience; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can grow nothing but confuſion and ruin; be their numbers never ſo great.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ilitary Architecture is a Science how to defend and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any place againſt the force of an Enemie.</p>
                     <p>Towns and Caſtles (ſays <hi>Vegetius</hi>) are either fortified by Nature, or by hands, or elſe by both. By Nature as being ſituate in ſome high abrupt place, or being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with the Sea, Lakes, or Rivers. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about <hi>Cilicia</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Helvetia</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> almoſt render them inacceſſible.</p>
                     <p>The Rock <hi>Aornis</hi> baffled the force of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Caſtles of <hi>Namur,</hi> and <hi>Hermenſtein,</hi> and many others in <hi>Europe,</hi> are almoſt invincible by reaſon of the Rocks which lie underneath them. <hi>Venice, Straltſound, Cuſtrine,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Holland,</hi> are defended by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that flow about them. So that you may ſee Nature in her fortifying of Towns, either caſts about them the Element of Earth or Water. And Art imitating Nature
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42528:119"/> (as it uſes to do) placed Walls and Rampars inſtead of Rocks and Mountains; and Moats or Ditches, where the Sea or Rivers have been wanting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>1</label> But as all beginnings are wont to be, ſo this of fortification was altogether ſimple and unskilful. They rais'd their walls to ſuch a height as might ſeem to deny the enemy an eaſie aſcent by his Ladders. The breadth was ſuch as would hold ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Rancks of armed men; nay <hi>Curtius</hi> reports the walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> were 32 feet broad. But this Structure had two faults in it, and both of them very dangerous. The firſt was that the defendants ſtanding on their wall without any covert lay open to their Enemy. The other was that the Enemy approaching under their wall, was ſo ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the wall it ſelf, that he could not be hurt by the defendants that ſtood on high over him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Errors at length they endeavour'd to remedie, by building throughout up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wall a breſtwork B C Z, the top of their breſtwork they diſtinguiſh'd with Battlements Z Z Z, not joyn'd together, but left open at certain diſtances, ſo that the defendants, cover'd with theſe Battlements, could beat off the enemy through their open intervals; ſo was the firſt Error in ſome manner ſublated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>2</label> To mend the other they cauſed loopholes to be cut in the wall at a mans height from the ground, marked with the letter P P P.</p>
                     <p>Nor yet were theſe inconveniences perfectly taken away, for the Enemy lying within the triangles D E F, G K H, would eſcape the ſhot of the Townsmen.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they began to look on a flancquing or ſide defence, and ſtill keeping <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>3</label> their battlements and loopholes they built round their work ſquare Turrets that ran out beyond the thickneſs of the walls, and ſo they added to their fore-right defence (which was only then in uſe) a flancquing or ſide defence; but this ſame ſide defence was as yet imperfect, becauſe the Enemy could be hid within the triangle I P K; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſquare Towers were not thought able enough to bear the brunt of Engines and and battering Rams.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>4</label> Therefore ſlighting their ſquare Turrets they made round ones; ſo the Triangle A C B, in which the Enemy was hid, became ſo much leſſened, that now he could not traverſe his battering Engines within it; and the Round form of Turrets was found to ſtand firmer than any other againſt the force of the batteries. And here the Art and endeavour of the Ancients reſted, till Gunpowder being found, men began to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Thunder and Lightning. And indeed this laſt way of Fortification was far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the former. Nevertheleſs the buſineſs went yet ſuſpected, for the Triangle A C B, was found large enough to ſhelter <hi>Pioneers,</hi> beſides the flancquing defence F C, D E, could ſcowr only one point of the round Towers, B C A, becauſe round bodies cannot be touched by right lines but in one point only.</p>
                     <p>At laſt Art conquered it ſelf, and found out that way of defence which we now uſe, turning the Walls into Rampars, and the round Turrets into Bulwarks fitted with face and flancque; and encloſed the whole Fortification with right or ſtreight lines. To conclude, it is brought ſo to paſs, that the Enemy let him ſtand where he will, ſhall lie open to the Shot of the defendants, and all the parts of the Fortification mutually defend one another.</p>
                     <p>Being about to treat of this laſt manner of fortification, I will keep ſuch Order, that when I ſhall have expounded the terms that are uſed in this matter, I ſhall then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Rules and Principles of the Art; and thus inſtructed, at laſt, God willing, we will fall upon the practice it ſelf.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A Fortification is a Place having ſuch a Circumference, whoſe each part receives from other parts a Flancquing or ſide Defence, beſides the fore-right De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence they yield themſelves. So that all parts mutually ſcowre one another. One part is ſaid to ſcowr or flanque one another, <label type="milestone">

                     <p n="2">2. To delineate a Fortification, is to deſcribe the out-lines of the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Regular Fortification is built upon a Regular Figure, hath all its parts equal and like placed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Regular Figure, is that which hath equal ſides and angles; ſuch is the Figure H K R P M N, all whoſe ſides K R, R P, P M, M N, N K, and angles N, M, P, R, K, are equal among themſelves: About this a Circle may be circumſcrib'd, that ſhall have the ſame Center H, as the Figure hath. The Angle of the Center is that which is contain'd between two Semidiameters K H, R H. The Angle of the Circumference, or of the Figure, is that which was contain'd between the ſides of the Figure, as M, P, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. An Irregular Fort, is that which is built on an Irregular Figure; an Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Figure is that which hath neither Sides nor Angles equal.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A Bulwork or Baſtion, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>6</label> is that part of the Fort B D H L M which moſt of all runs into the field.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THe end of Fortification, is that few may reſiſt many.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The form of the Fort muſt be ſuch, that all its parts may receive an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique flanquing-ſide defence, beſide the fore-right defence they afford themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Therefore each part of the Fortification, muſt flanque and be flanqued. The manner of flanquing is this: The face, which is the weakeſt part of the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is defended by the flanques of the Bulwork and Courtine, as alſo by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>5</label> face: The flanque of the Bulwork are defended by the Courtine, and the Courtine by the Flanques. <hi>Vid. fig.</hi> 5.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>6</label> 4. The ſhorter and obliquer the defence lines are, ſo much the ſtronger and ſurer. Now the Lines of defence will be ſo much the obliquer, as the Angle of defence G T H, ſhall be acuter.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>5</label> 5. The Fichant line B G, A G muſt not exceed a Muſquet-ſhot, that is 750 or 720 feet. The Bullet may be carried farther, but not to do execution at a mark. The Fichant line among all the Lines of the Fort is the chief, and doth it ſelf determinate the bigneſs of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Note. <hi>When we ſhall make mention of feet, you muſt underſtand them to be</hi> Rhyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>feet.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Being an Explanation of the foregoing Maxims.</head>
                     <p>ALL the reaſon and proportion of our Fortification will rely on the Rules delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the laſt Chapter. Therefore 'twill be here neceſſary more fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them; eſpecially thoſe which ſometimes all Ingineers did not approve of. The firſt, ſecond, and third want no expoſition.</p>
                     <p>About the 4th and 5th, although now no body diſagree, yet there was a time when men did doubt them. Some Military Architects, thoſe chiefly that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht in the former Age, did order ſuch a diſtance for the Baſtions, that the Fichant Line, or the longeſt Line of defence, ſhould not a little exceed a Muſquet ſhot. The Reaſon they brought was, that the place might better be defended with great Guns than with Muſquets: And therefore, becauſe great Guns cannot be ſo well level'd againſt an Enemy that's near, they required a greater diſtance for their Bulworks, and ſo the charge would be the leſs, the Town being defended with fewer Bulworks. But this way, by all modern Ingineers, is neglected, who with one conſent remove the Bulworks to ſuch a diſtance, that the Fichant Line might be meaſur'd with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot. What reaſon our former Architects brought for their opinion, is plainly none at all. For both by Reaſon and Experience 'tis evident, Towns may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defended with Muſquets than with Cannons; for the uſe of great Guns is very coſtly, ſlow, difficult; the execution they do, very rare and uncertain, ſo that 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Proverb, <hi>He is curſt in his Mothers belly, that's kil'd with a Cannon bullet.</hi> And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42528:121"/> if a great Gun ſhould be made uſeleſs, by being diſmounted, or by the death of the Gunner, or ſome other miſchance, all the Flanquing defence is loſt, to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Beſiegers. On the contrary, the uſe of Muſquets is not coſtly, but eaſie, ready, quick, and ſure. For who will deny, that an Enemy may not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be beat off with a thouſand ſmall Shot than one great Gun? A thing ſo clear needs no more arguments. Therefore let ſtand what we have appointed, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant line to be meaſured by a Muſquet-ſhot.</p>
                     <p>Nor do we exclude the uſe of great Guns from our defence; for in this modern way of Fortification, they may and ought to be admitted uſefully: We only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that the chief of the defence may rather be committed to Muſquets than to Cannons.</p>
                     <p>What we ordered in the 6th. and 7th. Rules, is the chiefeſt concern in the whole buſineſs of Fortification. The Faces of the Bulworks, becauſe they lye farther out than any of the other parts, are the weakeſt parts of the Fortification: The Flanque and Courtine are the ſtrongeſt, for they lie farther from the Enemy, and being near to one another, ſtoutly defend themſelves. Since then the Face is a place weaker than the reſt, and which the Enemy moſt uſually attaques, we ought with our chiefeſt care to help it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>7</label> There are two ſorts of Bulworks. In the firſt, the Face G V C, produced, falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the end of the Courtine F; for which reaſon the Face G C can only be defended from the Flanque of the Bulwork.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>5</label> In the ſecond form of Bulwork, the Face G F produced, does not fall upon the end of the Courtine, but in another point of it X, ſo that it leaves out a part of the Courtine X B, which is called the Flanque of the Courtine, from which the Face may be as well defended and ſcowred as from the Flanque of the Bulwork B C. The firſt they follow, that would have the Angle of the Bulwork a right Angle, in all Figures above a Pentagon.</p>
                     <p>The latter the <hi>Dutch</hi> firſt receiv'd, and made uſe of; who judged it beſt for their advantage to add to their defence ſecond Flanques in the Courtine, though with the loſs of a right Angle even in a <hi>Duodekagon.</hi> Neither is there any doubt, but this method is far better than the former, ſince it doth not only ſufficiently provide for the Angle of the Bulwork, which it never makes leſs than 60 degrees, but alſo increaſes the defence of the Faces often to twice as much as the former.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of the 8th Rule, which bids the Courtine be of a juſt length, is, that among all the parts of the Fortification the Courtine is the ſtrongeſt: For it lies diſtant from the Enemy farther than any other of the parts, and placed betwixt two Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, is very ſtrongly defended. Now 'tis very agreeable to reaſon, that the ſtrongeſt parts of the Fortification ſhould be longer than the weaker: Yet do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Courtine ſo far as to make the Fichant line above Muſquet-ſhot, for that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 5th Rule. The fitteſt proportion will be, if with <hi>Dogen</hi> or <hi>Fritach,</hi> you give it 432 feet, or with <hi>Goldman</hi> 480 feet.</p>
                     <p>The 9th and 10th Cannon treats of the Angle of the Bulwork; where a right Angle is preferr'd before any other, provided it do not too much obſtruct the reſt of the Rules.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding the Reaſon of this Rule, you muſt note, that right and obtuſe Angles do reſiſt the Cannon ſhot with their whole bodies, but an Acute one doth not with all his body. <label type="milestone">

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>7</label> Let there be a right angled Bulwork F O B Q P; and another Acute angled M L H D B. Now ſuppoſe the Bullets to fall in B O, the Face of the right angled Bulwork F O B Q P, from the Guns planted in R, by perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtrait-lines R B, R S. Therefore becauſe the two ſtrait Lines R B, B <hi>Q.</hi> are both perpendicular to B O, by ſuppoſition, in the ſame point B they will make one ſtrait Line R B Q. by the 14. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Euclide.</hi> From whence it is manifeſt, that the ſide of a right angled Bulwork B Q, objects its whole ſelf againſt the perpendicular ſhot R B: and ſo conſequently a right-angled Bulwork doth with his whole bulk oppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all the perpendicular ſhots R S.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42528:121"/>
                     <p>The ſame thing may be demonſtrated by ſtronger reaſon in an obtuſe Angle: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>6</label> But in an Acute Angle M L H DB, the perpendicular ſhots S H, S Q, being continued on, or protracted, in a little ſpace falls within the Bulwork, and ſo it appears the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work doth not object its whole body againſt the ſhot. From whence you may gather, that an Acute Angle is weaker than either a Right or obtuſe Angle.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being known, 'tis plainly manifeſt why a right Angle ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before an acute Angle; that is, if it can be had without prejudice to the reſt of the Maxims: And why it ſhould rather be choſen than an obtuſe one. Theſe are the Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that keeping the ſame Hancques Q P, O F, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>7</label> and the ſame Gorge Lines P E, F E, the Bulwork will be very much ſtraitned, which is againſt the 13th Rule; and the Angle of the ſhoulders P Q B made ſo much the leſs.</p>
                     <p>The other and chiefeſt reaſon is, that the obtuſer the Angle is, the leſſer will be the Flanque of the Courtine, or elſe all loſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore a Right Angle, or one near a Right Angle, muſt be given to the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work as oft as may be, but ſo that one clauſe in the Rule be not neglected, which forbids you to ſpoil the ſecond Flanque for the deſire of a right Angle: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a <hi>Hexagon,</hi> and the figures following to a <hi>Duodekagon,</hi> a Right Angle in the Bulwork will cut off the ſecond Flanque in the Courtine, we judge it better, with moſt of the famous Engineers of this Age, to detract ſomething from the Angle of the Bulwork, keeping notwithſtanding a due ſtrength for him, than to want the Flanque in the Courtine to the prejudice of our defence, which will be ſo much leſſened. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leduc</hi> and others followed the contrary; but moſt people now a dayes being taught by Experience, the School-miſtriſs of all things, have forſaken them.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon and ſenſe of the reſt of the Rules is ſo plain, that they need no farther Explanation.</p>

                        <p>All theſe ſeveral ways of Fortification agree with the Canons delivered in the 3d. and 4th. Chapters. <hi>The Fourth</hi> ſeems leaſt in uſe (ſo I gather out of <hi>Fritach</hi> pag. 15.) <hi>The Fifth</hi> is more uſed. <hi>The Second and Third</hi> are much alike. Betwixt theſe (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond and third) and the fourth, the <hi>Sixth</hi> is a mean, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Dogen</hi> is to be prefer'd before them. <hi>The Firſt</hi> goes beyond all the reſt for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42528:123"/> largeneſs of the ſecond Flanque, and comes ſhort of all the reſt in the firſt Flanque, the neck, the faces, and in the Angle of the Bulwork. Whence it is conſequent, he ſhould have his Bulworks leſs than any of the reſt. His Courtine is larger than the others by 48 feet. This ſeems to be leſs in uſe than any of the other.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Data,</hi> or things given in the ſecond and fifth, differ about the, Flanque, which in the fifth is bigger: For which reaſon it hath its Gorge line and ſecond Flanque leſſer. The third and fourth in their <hi>Data's</hi> differ about the Angle of the Bulwork and the Flanque. The Flanque in the fourth is leſſer: the Angle of the Bulwork is bigger, except in a <hi>Hexagon.</hi> Where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THe ſole and main buſineſs of the delineation hitherto expounded, was truly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute or form the Rampars circumference, compleated with Faces, Flanque and Courtine, which indeed is the fundamental &amp; principal work of all Martial Structures. But now to preſcribe the dimenſions of the Rampar it ſelf, and the reſt of its parts, as to their height and thickneſs, is the buſineſs of Orthography. Every Fortification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts almoſt of theſe parts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Rampar, Breſtwork, Fauſs bray, Ditch or Moat, the Couvert way, and an out-Breſtwork. Yet if the Ditch be dry, the Fauſs-bray both may, and is wont to be omitted. In this Chapter we ſhall ſpeak of the dimenſions of the Rampar and Breſtwork.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spartans</hi> in former times would not defend their City with Walls and Ditches: and King <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſhowing his armed citizens to one that asked why <hi>Sparta</hi> wanted Walls, ſaid, that thoſe were the Walls of <hi>Sparta.</hi> This was plainly a fooliſh and empty oſtentation of ſtrength, relying on no ſound councel, but only raſhneſs; which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42528:125"/> the experience of all nations hath condemn'd, and which the <hi>Spartans</hi> had almoſt found fatal to themſelves in the <hi>Theban</hi> War. But leaving this wee'l come to the purpoſe.</p>

                           <hi>II.</hi> The Height of the Rampar.</head>
                        <p>There is hardly any thing ſo deſtructive to a Fortification as a high Rampar. This errour hath been committed in moſt of the ancient Fortifications, eſpecially thoſe of the moſt famous cities in <hi>Europe;</hi> for theſe high Rampars flatter the ſight, and make a ſhow of Strength where there is none, when indeed they ſpoyl the whole defence, and betray the Town to the Enemy; and leaſt ſo great miſchief might be had <hi>gratis,</hi> the Treaſury muſt be alſo drain'd to obtain it.</p>
                        <p>The fault of high Rampars conſiſts chiefly in this, that they ſhelter the enemy when he draws near them from the Shot of the Townsmen. This to its own great loſs, <hi>Breda</hi> hath taught us, when it was laſt beſieged by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had fortified this Town with great care and expence, ſo that it might ſeem to be reckon'd one of the compleateſt Fortifications of <hi>Europe;</hi> but the height of the Rampar flattering his ſight, as I ſaid, deceived him. The Inhabitants of <hi>Breda</hi> being afterwards beſieged by <hi>Frederick, Mauritius</hi> his Brother, were not able from their high Rampar with all their Cannon to remove the enemy approaching nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto them; nor his Blinds ſtealing by degrees upon them; whence they were forced to cut holes in ſeveral places of their high Rampar that was rais'd at ſuch great charges, and pull it down, and level it, to make a place for lower Batteries, from whence they might ſurer hit and break the fatal Blinds of the Enemy. But theſe high Rampars cannot be ſo mended, but they'l be marr'd worſe in another point; for while they are cut in many places, the binding together and joynting of the work is looſned, ſo that 'twill eaſily fall if batter'd with the Enemies Cannon.</p>
                        <p>But a Rampar that riſes to an indifferent height hath not this deadly inconvenience,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fig.</hi> 9.</note> as is manifeſt in it ſelf; nay and Musquet Shot doth more Execution from a low Station than from a high one; For let there be two heights, A B the bigger, A C the leſſer, and let the Line D E at the height of a man ſtand perpendicular upon the <hi>Horizon:</hi> Now it is clear the line or Shot which is directed from C to E, ſhall fall beyond that line or Shot which ſhall be directed from B to E, and intercepts a larger ſpace on the Earth D F; whereas the other from B paſſing through E, intercepts only the ſpace D G: Therefore more ground may be ſcowred from a low place than from a higher.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps thoſe that are the Patrons of high Rampars will ſay they cannot be ſo eaſily climb'd, and that the Enemies approaches may better be diſcovered from them.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer the inconvenience now alledged muſt prevail, for an ordinary height will ſufficiently hinder the aſcent of the Enemy; and for diſcovering his approaches you may raiſe Cavalliers in the Bulworks.</p>

                        <p>And becauſe Rampars and their Breſtworks ought to be Cannon proof, I will briefly add, how much ground a Shot can penetrate. A whole Cannon at 400 feet diſtance, with a Ball of 48 pound, ſhall ſtrike 20 feet deep into firm Earth. A Demy-Cannon at the diſtance of 300 feet with a Ball of 24 <hi>l.</hi> ſhall enter 12 feet of firm ground. A Field piece at the diſtance of 200 feet, with a Ball of 12. <hi>l.</hi> ſhall paſs through about 7 feet of firm ground. This <hi>Goldman</hi> reports.

                           <hi>VII.</hi> Of a Rampar Caſed with Stone.</head>
                        <p>A Rampar caſed with Stone is to be preferr'd before a bare one, 1. becauſe it chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly hinders nocturnal invaſions, and ſudden attempts, ſince the enemy cannot mount it without Ladders, the providing of which will be very troubleſome, and the uſe as uncertain. 2. Becauſe it hinders an open aſſault, ſince it cannot be attempted but by Ladders, which will be to no purpoſe, or by the ruines of the wall thrown down with Mines. 3. Becauſe it is a ſtable and everlaſting work; whereas a bare Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par, unleſs it be continually repaired, falls to the ground.</p>
                        <p>They that diſagree, reaſon after this manner. 1. That Walls battered with Cannon ſooner fall than the bare Earth. 2. Their Stones beaten down fill up the Ditch. 3. That the pieces or Splinters of the ſtones flying about will hurt the defendants. The firſt I deny, if the Walls be very thick, or if (as I ordered) propt with an earthen Rampar. As to the ſecond, 'twill be the ſame thing, or rather worſe in a bare Rampar. The third is avoided, if you do not raiſe the wall to the top of the Rampar, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Wall of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> This inconvenience will be much leſs if you make the walls of Brick.</p>

                        <p>Upon the Rampar there is always a Breſtwork built 4 G, I K 3,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fig.</hi> 8.</note> whoſe dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are theſe following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The inward height</hi> T 4 muſt be always 6 feet, that it may conveniently ſhelter the Souldiers, who ſeldome exceed this meaſure.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The outward height</hi> 2 K muſt be feet, for ſo not only the field and the out-Breſtwork, but alſo a great part of the Ditch will be defended by the Rampar; and you may know how much, if you can come to the knowledg of C φ, which will be found after this manner; as I O is to O K, ſo is I C to C φ. The three firſt terms are known, therefore the fourth C φ muſt be known. Now from C V known, take C φ known, there will remain φ V alſo known.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The inward Talu</hi> D I muſt be always 1 foot; there is no need of a greater, ſince it lies from the Enemie, and is propt up ſufficiently by the Step or Banquet G 4 D, neither is it expoſed to the feet of men always running up it, as the inward ſide of the Rampar.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>The outward Talu</hi> 2 3. muſt be always 2 feet; for ſince the outward ſide of the Breſtwork K 3 lies in a ſtreight Line, with the outward ſide of the Rampar 3 E, and K 2, 3 F, are parallel. 'Tis evident that the Triangles 2 K 3, F 3 E, are like Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles. Therefore ſince in the fourth number we ordered the outward <hi>Talu</hi> of the Rampar E F, to be half the height of the Rampar F 3, 32 will alſo be half the height 2 K: But 2 K was appointed to be always 4 feet, therefore 32 will be always 2 feet.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>The upper thickneſs</hi> O K, muſt be Cannon proof, therefore ſince a whole Cannon will ſcarce ſtrike through 20 feet of Earth, 21 feet may ſuffice.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>The lower thickneſs</hi> D 3 is compoſed of the two <hi>Talues</hi> D T 32, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thickneſs O K; the two <hi>Talues</hi> taken together, make 3 feet, and the upper thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 21 feet, ſo that the lower thickneſs will be 24 feet.</p>
                        <p>And here again our Engineers ſport it, and for the variety of the Figures alter the thickneſſes after this manner.</p>

                        <p>EXperience hath taught us in the taking of many Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> that ſo ſoon as the Out-works are taken in, the Moat without any great difficulty will be covered with Galleries, and ſo conquered; for the water in the Moat hindering the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the beſieged, the Builders of the Galleries can only be called from the oppoſite flanques, being ſafe before by reaſon of the neceſſary height of the Rampar which protects the Enemy lying ſo near under it from the Shot and ſight of the beſieged. Againſt ſo deadly an inconvenience the Breſtwork 5 N P Q R is built, at the foot of the Rampar, which is called commonly Fauſs-bray, or <hi>parapet des Rondes:</hi> And in this alone conſiſts the ſafety of a Moat or wet Ditch. For from this the beſiegers are beat off on all ſides, with Shot almoſt quite level or <hi>Horizontal;</hi> And therefore ſurer to do Execution, as I ſhewed in the eighth chapter, number the ſecond. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only End of a Fauſs-bray, is the defence of a Moat, which help, a dry ditch doth not ſtand in need of, as ſhall be taught hereafter.</p>

                        <p>Some <hi>Architects</hi> ſharply contend, that ſuch a height ought to be given to the Fauſs-bray, as might make it able to command the Out-works. But the defence of the Out-works will better be perform'd by the Rampar it ſelf; and as much as you ſhall add to the height of the Fauſs-bray, ſo much will you diminiſh from the defence of the graft: Therefore let it not exceed humane ſtature. The reſt of its Structure is the ſame in all things, as that of the Breſtwork of the Rampar, delivered in the eighth Chapter, numb. 8.</p>

                           <hi>I.</hi> Whether a dry Ditch or Graft be better than a Moat.</head>
                        <p>THere is not a queſtion more frequent amongſt Engineers; and many now prefer the dry one. The inconveniences of a Moat are theſe; it keeps the beſieged in like Priſoners, that they cannot ſally out upon the Enemy, unleſs a Covert way and Out-breſtwork be rais'd beyond it at very great expences: And when the Out-breſtwork ſhall be taken, it cannot defend it ſelf, ſince there is no going on it but by little boats. Therefore the Galleries are eaſily brought over the Moat unto the Rampar, as Experience hath often taught the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the water hindring the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, that they cannot run down into the Ditch, with handy blows to throw down the Fatal Engine. This defect however, is ſupplied by building a Fauſs-bray, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velins and Half-moons, at vaſt expences, and the entertainment of a far greater Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Therefore a Moat is both of it ſelf weak, and keeps the Towns-men in like Priſoners, ſo that they cannot come to beat off the Enemy any other way than by firing at a diſtance, though they ſee him ſpring his Mines, and bring the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the Town; beſides, the Fauſs-bray is built only for the ſecurity of the Moat, as is the Out-breſtwork and the Couvert way, and in fine, all ſorts of Out-works; and it requires a far greater number of Souldiers to defend it.</p>
                        <p>A dry Ditch, ſafe in its own ſtrength, doth not need theſe chargable Out-works, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially an Out-breſtwork it never wants: For as the Moat keeps in the Souldiers like Priſoners, the dry Ditch conveys them ſafe and unſeen on the Enemy. Neither have theſe that ſally any need of a Couvert-way, ſince the Ditch can hide them in its own bottom; nor have they any need of an Out-breſtwork, ſince the out-ſide of the Ditch it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> if it have ſteps made to it, is able to ſupply the place of an Out-breſtwork.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42528:128"/> Nay, there is no ſort of Out-work required, ſince they are rais'd only to keep the Enemy from the Ditch and Rampar, which will be better perform'd by Sallies, which may be made ſafely through the dry Ditch. Again, a dry Ditch makes an eaſie and ſafe retreat for thoſe that ſally, when they are wholly purſued by the Enemy: But a wet Ditch would either exclude or drown them; for there is no paſſage from Out-work to Out-work, or from the Out-works to the principal Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par, but what is made by little narrow wooden bridges, which can receive but few at a time; and if they are crowded too much, as commonly in ſuch caſes it happens, they yield to their weight, and are broken: As it fell out when <hi>Breda</hi> was laſt beſieged, in the taking of <hi>Ginekens</hi> Horn-work, with the great loſs of their ſtouteſt Souldiers periſhing in the waters. To conclude, ſince a dry Ditch can ſafely be without Half-moons, Ravelins, Horn-works, and Out-breſtworks, and all other Out-works, or at leaſt may neglect them far ſafer than a wet Ditch can; we muſt confeſs that the Town, if it were beſieged, would be defended with a far leſs Garriſon.</p>
                        <p>It plainly appear'd at the ſiege of <hi>Maſtreicht,</hi> the ſharpeſt of all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Sieges, how far a dry Ditch is to be prefer'd before a wet one. The ditches of the Town being partly wet, partly dry, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> conſulted with his Captains which was beſt to fall upon; who reſolved to attempt the dry one; but the taking of it was ſo ſlow and ſo difficult, that the Prince confeſs'd his error, and reſolved, after that, never to try the taking of a dry Ditch before a wet one: That I may omit the reſt of the action; in this moſt valiant defence. The Townſmen from the Ditch it ſelf brought forth their Mines, to blow up the lines of Approaches, with ſuch facility and ſucceſs, that the Enemy was forced to ſpend five weeks to gain a Line of five Perches: Then with Skirmiſhes, Works and Countermines, they ſo tired the <hi>Dutch</hi> that beſieged them, that the Prince deſpairing to bring his Line over the dry Ditch, was conſtrain'd to carry a Mine into the Town, under the bottom of it, which was very near forty feet lower than the level of the Town.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding, 'tis to be confeſs'd, the nocturnal attempts and ſurpriſes of the Enemy are better kept off by a wet Ditch than by a dry one; yet there is great danger from the water it ſelf being once frozen, unleſs the Ice be always broke; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the taking of <hi>Wachtendonch</hi> by the Dutch, and <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> by the Emperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, by a ſurpriſe in the dark, over their Moats that were frozen.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe things are controverted on both ſides, This is my opinion, that a dry Ditch is beſt againſt open Aſſaults, and the wet one beſt againſt Surpriſes: But becauſe all ſurpriſes and ſuddain attempts may be prevented by the care and vigilancy of the Officers and Souldiers, but open force no other way but by force, it ſeems to me the dry Ditch is abſolutely to be choſen, if the nature of the ground will permit it: Eſpecially ſince a great deal of money is ſpared, which otherwiſe would have been ſpent in building the Fauſſe-bray and the Out-works.</p>

                        <p>For the moſt part it is ordered to be ten or twelve feet; but it cannot be leſs than ſix feet, otherwiſe a wet Ditch might be waded over, and a dry Ditch would not cover a man ſtanding. But why a Ditch having the Width s above-determin'd, and its depth ten feet, ſhould ſupply earth enough to raiſe the Rampar and its Breſtwork, the Fauſs-bray and Out-breſtwork: Thus I demonſtrate. Meaſure the Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Sections of the Rampar and its Breſtwork A LIKE, the Fauſs-bray 5 N P Q R; and of the Out-breſtwork 6 X Y Z, and multiply their ſum into the principal Perimeter of the Fortification, which will be known, if all the Courtines, Faces, Flanques, be added among themſelves. But the Orthographical Sections, and the Perimeter of the Fortification muſt be meaſured with one and the ſame meaſure, and the product ſhall give a ſolid almoſt equal to the aggregate of the Rampar, and its Breſtwork, the Fauſs-bray and Out-breſtwork. In like manner, the Ditch will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equal to the ſolid that ſhall be produced out of the multiplication of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographical Section of the Ditch S 8 7 V, into the Perimeter that paſſeth through the middle point of its Width α: Therefore becauſe the Ditch ought to be equal to the aggregate of the Works, 'twill be by the <hi>Corrol.</hi> of the 34th of the 11th of <hi>Euclide.</hi> As the Perimeter paſſing by α, is to the principal Perimeter of the Fortification; ſo is the ſum of the Sections of the Rampar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Section of the Ditch S 8 7 V, which is conſequently known, becauſe it is a fourth proportional to three quantities known. Now becauſe S V is known, and its half S α, that is α β for ſince S H is equal to H 8, S α will be equal to α β, by the 4. 6. <hi>Euclid.</hi> Therefore β α multiplied into S α ſhall give the Triangle S β V; from which ſubſtract S 8 7 V, already known, and there will remain the Triangle 8 β 7 alſo known. Then as the Triangle S β V is to the Square of α β, ſo is the Triangle 8 β 7 to the Square of π β; wherefore ſince three terms are known, the fourth alſo will be known, which is the Square of π β, whoſe root is the Line β π, which ſubſtracted from β α (that is S α) ſhall give α π the depth of the Ditch, which this way is found to be near ten feet. If you need any more Earth to raiſe batteries for Cannon and Cavaliers, make your Ditch ſomething deeper about the Bulworks: If there be no Fauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The firſt Column ſhews you the largeſt and ſtrongeſt Orthography, which is able to ſuſtain the greateſt force of the Beſiegers. The ſecond is able to bear an indifferent Siege. The third is made againſt the leaſt ſtrength which is uſually ſent againſt Towns. But here we only treat of the Forts themſelves; I ſhall hereafter give you the Orthography of Caſtles and Out-works. And again, I had no proportion or reſpect to the diverſity of the Figures or Polygons, as many Engineers have; who for no reaſon, as I can tell, give to a <hi>Pentagon</hi> a different Orthography from that which they give to a <hi>Hexagon</hi> or a <hi>Nonagon.</hi> For a ſtronger or weaker Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is to be given a Fortification, not as it hath more or leſs Angles or Bulworks, but as it ought to reſiſt a greater or leſs ſtrength of an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Note, <hi>If the Fortification be made without a Fauſs-bray, the Out-breſtwork will have another Baſe, for it will be a fourth proportional to the three terms</hi> I 9, 9 Y, Y λ, <hi>but the mean or middle term</hi> 9 Y <hi>will be leſs by the ſpace E R, if the Fauſs-bray be wanting, and then the baſe of the Breſtwork</hi> λ Z <hi>will be</hi>

                     <p>A Fortification formed according to its eſſential parts, is made ſtronger if it be ſurrounded with ſome Out-works. The chief of which is a Raveline, a Half-moon, a Horn-work, a Crown-work, and Tongs. I ſhall treat of each of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in the following propoſitions.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="proposition">

Such an one is F E G H, in the 10th. <hi>Figure,</hi> its faces are F E, G E. It wants, as I ſaid, for the moſt part flanques, yet it admits of them when it is built before Gates, which then will be about 8 or 9 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Towards the Enemy it is built with a Rampar and Breſtwork, and lies open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Fortification, leaſt it might ſhelter the Enemie when he hath poſſeſt it, it is rais'd but a little height above the level of the ground, that it may be better defended from the main Fortification, and the plains the better ſcowred by it.</p>
                           <p>Its Angle muſt not be leſs than 60 degr. nor more than a right Angle. The length of the faces is determin'd in Regular Fortifications, <hi>numb.</hi> 3. If they are applyed to the covering of a Courtine that is above its juſt length, obſerve this, that the faces muſt not be longer than the faces of the Bulworks, therefore they may be about 40, 50, or 60 paces.</p>

The 10th. <hi>Figure</hi> ſhews the Situation of it, as it lyes before a Courtine; 'tis beſt to have it of ſuch a breadth as might cover the Courtine only, and not the flanques, for then 'tis defended by the faces and flanques of the Bulworks that it lies betwixt.</p>

There are three kinds of Horn-works; the firſt hath its ſides inclining to one another towards the Field; the ſecond towards the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and the third's are parallel.</p>

                           <p>They are built oppoſite to the Courtine, or the Angle of the Bulwork, beyond the Out-breſtwork: Yet they are better defended if they cover the Courtine, than if the Bulwork, eſpecially if the ſides, are parallel: For when they cover the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works with parallel ſides, they receive no other defence than from the Courtine, and that to little purpoſe, ſince at ſo great a diſtance; beſides, after this manner the work would be too narrow: Yet if they are to be placed before Bulworks, 'tis altogether neceſſary the ſides ſhould incline to one another towards the Bulworks, that ſo they may not take in all the faces, but exclude ſome part of them from which they may be defended. See the Conſtruction in <hi>Dogen,</hi> pag. 160, 161.</p>
                           <p>If they are built before the Courtine, let their ſides be rather parallel, and perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular on the Courtine. If they cover the whole Courtine (as ſome will have it, and as we have expreſs'd in the Figure) their defence will be from the faces of thoſe Bulworks that the Courtine lyes betwixt. If it does not cover the whole Courtine, as others will have it, the defence of the ſides will be the greater; to wit, both from the faces of the Bulworks, and from part of the Courtine. Betwixt the Horn-work and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42528:132"/> the Courtine, there is commonly rais'd a Raveline; nay, before the work it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt each of its Horns, a Raveline, or rather an Half-moon may be built. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, you will add a great deal of ſtrength to this work, if you make ſome Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But of that afterwards.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Let there be drawn two parallels E I, F K, for the ſides of the Horn-work, from the Out-breſtwork towards the field, at ſuch a diſtance, that if they were produced towards the main Work, they might fall in a ſtrait Line with the flanques of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works; or if you deſire a leſs breadth for the Horn-work, let them fall within the flanques on the Courtine it ſelf. But the ends of theſe ſides muſt not be above Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot from the Rampar, wherefore they muſt not run beyond the Rampar above ſixty <hi>Rhynland</hi> Perches: Yet theſe ſixty <hi>Rhynland</hi> Perches uſe to be counted from the Out-breſtwork, that ſo the approaches of the Enemy might be the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
                           <p>Joyn E F, on which make the Angles F E G, E F H twenty five degrees each; then biſect one of theſe F E G; with the right Line E L meeting with F H in C; then from E G cut off E D equal to F C, ſo will F C, E D, be the faces of the half Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. From the point D and C draw D A and C B, equal and parallel to E I and F K, for the flanques of the Horns, and joyn the Courtine A B, the proportion of the flanques D A and C B, to the faces, will be almoſt the ſame as uſes to be in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Fortifications.</p>
                           <p>Alſo after this manner following, the Capital and Gorge lines, the Flanques and Courtine will be with more eaſe determin'd: For ⅓ of E F gives the Capitals E N and F M; alſo ⅓ of M N or E F gives the Gorge lines N A, M B, and there remains for the Courtine A B alſo ⅓; the right Lines M E, N F, will determine the length of the Flanques rais'd from A and B; and ſo alſo the faces E D, F C will be found.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things being done, a Horn-work is delineated, ſuch as uſes to be ſtretched before the Courtines in a Regular Fortification; the delineation of the reſt will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed almoſt by the like method, having alwayes a reſpect to the place.</p>

                           <p>If Ravelins, Half-moons and Horn-works, are built about a fortified place, the Fortification is accounted moſt compleat and perfect, whoſe uſe conſiſts moſt in this; 1. They keep off the Enemy far from the Fortification. 2. They are taken with a great deal of difficulty; for they are defended from the Courtine, from the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and from the adjacent Works, and ſome Lines from the Out-breſtwork it ſelf. 3. Being taken and poſſeſs'd, they can hardly be kept, becauſe they lye open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Fortification. 4.

                           <p>Moreover, the defect of theſe Tonges, and of all external Angles, is this; that about its very Angle it affords the Enemy a certain Quadrangular ſpace, within which he need not be expos'd to the ſhot of the Defendants; this ſpace is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, if the outward ſloaping ſurface of the Breſtwork be conceiv'd to be produc'd till it cut the field; its capacity is almoſt equal to twenty three <hi>Rhynland</hi> Perches, which will be eaſily computed.

                           <p>Since 'tis moſt an end the part of ſome Regular Fortification, let the Engineer look, what Fortification is fitteſt for the place of the Polygon that is to be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; which when he hath found, let him delineate ſo many Bulworks of that Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which is built on the obſerv'd Polygon, as the place requires; only this let him obſerve, that the Angles of the half Bulwork be not leſs than ſixty, nor more than ninety degrees. Its Bulworks are wont ſometimes to be leſs than thoſe of the main Work. But let us expound more eſpecially the conſtruction of a Crown-work having one whole Bulwork.</p>
                           <p>The whole deſcription is made after this manner. Let the Capital of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work be produced infinitely; or if the Crown is to be ſet before the Courtine, from the middle point of the Courtine raiſe an Infinite perpendicular; on the Capital pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſet off from B to D forty <hi>Rhynland</hi> Perches; on the perpendicular of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine you may reckon ſixty or ſeventy; for ſo the ſides of the Crown-work will be yet within the ſhot of a Muſquet coming from the Bulworks of the main Fort.</p>
                           <p>Then at the point of D, of the right line B D, make the Angle B D I, half of ſome <hi>Multangle</hi> or <hi>Polygon,</hi> and on the other ſide the Angle B D K; then in the ſides of theſe Angles from D to I and K, reckon 40 or 50 perches, at moſt 60; and laying a Ruler by the point I, to the flanque of the Bulwork F, as alſo from the point K to the other flanque E, draw ſtrait lines till they meet with the Out-breſtwork in M and L, ſo will the ſides of the <hi>Crown-work</hi> be determin'd by the Out-breſtwork.</p>
                           <p>But if the ſides M I, L K, exceed 60 perches, that is, a Muſquet-Shot, the Angles B D I, B D K, muſt be made leſs, (Yet ſo that the whole I D K may remain bigger than a right Angle) or certainly (which is thought beſt) the Line B D muſt be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                           <p>Then ſee what Regular Figure's Angle is equal, or comes near to the Angle K D I: ſay for Example an <hi>Heptagon</hi> or ſeven-angled figure; therefore make within K D I one whole Bulwork and two half Bulworks of an <hi>Heptagon,</hi> by the help of your Tables.</p>
                           <p>If you would place more whole Bulworks in the middle, let the ſides of the <hi>Horn-work</hi> be drawn forth, ſo that they do not exceed Muſquet-Shot, and within theſe build part of a Regular Fortification, as hath been ſaid above.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Some of theſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> thoſe that are wont to be uſed in ſtrengthening Regular For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, we have already expounded. And although their manner of building there delivered, be proper to Regular Fortifications, yet out of this 'tis eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how they are to be fitted to an Irregular place. Now theſe that are over and above, are to be explain'd in this Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Double or Triple Bulwork,</hi> is a Moat or Bulk of Earth compoſed of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bulworks placed one above another; 'tis ſhewn in the 15th. figure, and is built commonly in ſteep places, ſuch as the ſides of Hills, that when the Enemy coming up can be no longer touched from the loweſt, he might be hot from the ſecond, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the third; theſe are ſeldome uſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Forked or cut Bulworks,</hi> I call thoſe whoſe Angle E is cut off, and chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an external Angle F K G, after this manner in the 16th figure is the Mole or Bulk A C FK G D B; they are of uſe when the Angle of the Bulwork is too acute.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Half-Bulworks,</hi> you have in the <hi>Horn-work,</hi> fig. 10. and in the <hi>Crown-work,</hi> fig. 14. They are not only to be uſed in <hi>Horn-works</hi> and <hi>Crown-works.</hi> but alſo in many
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42528:134"/> other places, as we ſhall ſay afterwards. Obſerve that the Angle of theſe be not too acute, and take care that their plain ſide be not deſtitute of defence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The external Angle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 17.</note> is that which is made by two lines running inwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Center of the place called in French <hi>angle retire;</hi> on the contrary, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Angle</hi> is that which is made by the ſides running forth towards the field from the Center of the place, called in French <hi>angle Avance.</hi> In the 17th. figure the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Angles are, A, L, C, E, G, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The inward B, D, F, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The outward Angle, if it be not too obtuſe, ſeems ſtrong enough, ſince its ſides do mutually ſcowr one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and from this is had the defence of the Tonges and Forked Bulworks. We have above ſhowed its defect.</p>
                     <p>Some people extoll this ſo, as to think a place ſurrounded with outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Angles, to be equal in ſtrength to one that is fortified with Bulworks, but they are not to be heard.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For firſt, it always happens, that when a place is incloſed with External and internal Angles ſet alternately, ſome of the outward will be too blunt or obtuſe; as A L, and ſome of the inward too acute, either of which is very hurtful. The laſt in this, that its Angle is liable to be cut off by the Enemies Canon. The other, in that it looſes ſo much the more of its ſcowring defence the nearer it comes to a ſtrait line.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The outward Angles likewiſe have this Eſſential inconvenience, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie drawing near the Angle it ſelf, cannot be hot within a notable ſpace, as we have ſhewn above, which fault the Bulworks are without.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe External Angles do leſſen the <hi>Area</hi> of the place, and increaſe the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, both which is faulty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Angular Tonges,</hi> are wont to be uſed in fortifying an acute external Angle,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 18, 19.</note> or a right one; but not ſo conveniently an obtuſe one: with help of theſe you may mend the ſecond fault ſpoken of above; you muſt build it after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Produce A B, E B, the ſides of the Angle, 8 or 10 paces to K and N, and joyn K N; then draw K E, N G parallel to B A, B E, likewiſe C E, D G parallel to B E and B A, which may meet with the former in E and G. If all the ſpace contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the Lines C E K N G D be emptied and cleared, you have the Tonges ſought for.</p>
                     <p>Some build it after this manner, omitting the Line K N,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 19.</note> and ſlighting the Triangle F B N, they empty only the ſpaces C E F B, B N G D; yet the firſt ſeems to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, becauſe in it the defence is not only had from the flanques E K, G N, but alſo from K N, which is as it were a little Courtine; but the other wants this defence, and its ſides B F, B N are almoſt uſeleleſs for defence. But if they are to be built with a wall, (as for the moſt part they ought to be) the labour is doubled and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profit, becauſe F B and B N are bigger than F N, and as I ſaid unuſeful. On the ends of the ſides of the Angle which is ſtrengthened with the Tonges, half-Bulworks, X, Z, are always wont to be made.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Plain Moles,</hi> ſerve for the ſtrengthening obtuſe outward Angles,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 20.</note> leſs fit for acute and right ones: you ſhall build them after this manner.</p>
                     <p>From the ſides of the outward Angle E B D cut off the right lines B A, B C 25 or 30 paces, and raiſe the Perpendicles A H, C I equal unto them, and joyn H I; ſo will A H I C be the Plain Mole, whoſe flanques A H and C I, will ſcowr the ſides of the Angle A E, C D, and theſe will be ſcowred by them. But the Front H I will be ſcowred by N E, M D the ſegments of the ſides which the Front produced cuts off on both ſides. Therefore the ſides of the Angle ought to be ſo long that they may cut the Front prolong'd on both ſides, and the parts N E, M D, muſt be of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity, leaſt otherwiſe the Front want its defence.</p>
                     <p>This work is better then the Tonges, becauſe it enlarges the places, and is capable of great Retrenchments.</p>

                     <p>IRregular places may be ſtrengthened two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Regularly and Irregularly. An Irregular place is ſaid to be Regularly fortified, when it is ſo changed, as that it may become Regular; or if it cannot be produced to Regularity, a Regular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is circumſcrib'd about it. But an Irregular place is fortified irregularly when the Figure of the place is not reduced to a Regular one.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Deſcribe the plain of the place to be fortified, and obſerve what Regular Figure it comes neareſt to, and reduce it to that you find neareſt. The Reduction muſt be ſo, that all thoſe parts of the old circumference that can be uſed, muſt be retain'd: The reſtare to be excluded with a new circumference, if the place be large; or inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rather, if the place be only of a mean capacity. Now a place reduced after this manner, will be fortified according to the laws of Regular Fortifications.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if the Figure of the place be ſo Irregular, as not to be reduced to a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, 'twill behoove you to circumſcribe about it a Regular Figure. But that you may know how many ſides the Figure circumſcrib'd is to have, meaſure the largeſt Radius of the place you intend to incloſe, then turn to the Tables of Regular For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and obſerve what Figures Radius, your Radius is equal to, or neareſt; and what Figures Radius you find it to be, that Figure you muſt circumſcribe.</p>

That ſide is unfit that leaves more than five hundred, or leſs than three hundred feet. <hi>Dogen</hi> pronounces one ſide to be unfit, that is leſs than the ſide of a ſquare Regular Figure: Therefore look in the Tables for the Neck-lines of a ſquare Fortification, and cut them off at each end from every particular ſide; and if the remainder be no leſs than three hundred feet, or more than five hundred feet, the ſide are fit.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Seek therefore in your Tables (Chap 5.) the Neck-lines that ſerve for a Square, which let be A H, A H, cut off from the ſides: Seek alſo the flanques of a Square, which being rais'd perpendicularly from H, H let be H G, H G. Then biſecting the Angle A, with an infinite Right line A Q, cut off from it the Capital line of a Square A F, likewiſe found in the Table, and joyn F G, FG: ſo you have H G F G H the Bulwork of a ſquare Fortification. Where note, that if the leaſt Angle be 100 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or betwixt 110 or 108, you muſt give to the Flanques ſeventy feet.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If on the reſt of the Angles you make Bulworks belonging to a Square, the Fortification will be compleat and perfect.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If the Courtine, and flanques in the Courtine, be in ſome places too little, there make the Bulwork of a Regular Figure next leſs, till your Courtine be long enough; you may alſo leſſen the Angle of the Bulwork if the Flanques are too ſhort, ſtill preſerving its juſt bigneſs ſpoke of in the <hi>Maxims,</hi> On the contrary, you may increaſe the Angle of the Bulwork, if the flanque of the Courtine be very big.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Very great Angles, to wit, ſuch as are bigger than 150 degrees, ſhall be forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as right ſides; that is, you ſhall ſo fortifie each ſide of the Angle, as if it were one Courtine: The manner will be delivered afterwards.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Bulworks being built after this form, by help of the leaſt Angle; if the Courtine, and flanques of the Courtine, be of that length, that that they may be ſhortned, ſtill preſerving their due quantity, then 'twill be lawful to increaſe the Angle of the Bulwork by increaſing either the Flanques or Neck-lines, or both together; and ſo will you take, away any inconvenience that might be in this way; neither will there be any thing that <hi>Dogen</hi> can condemn; nor ſuch need of that troubleſome new invention of Lines, found by the Rule of Proportion.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. AN ancient Rampar if it be ſtrong and ſurrounded with a Wall and Towers, muſt not be demoliſh'd; therefore you muſt incloſe it with a new fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt be Regular, if poſſible, or as near a Regular as might be.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. If the ancient Fortifications be of Earth, or can be mended without much coſt and labour, then proceed according to the Rules of Irregular Fortification already delivered. Many French and Dutch Cities are fortified with Ravelins, Halfmoons, Hornworks, and other ſort of works: which ſort of building ſince 'tis to ſupply the place of Bulworks ought to be ſtronger than uſual. They are likewiſe frequently fortified with a Fauſs-bray, and the Breſtwork of the Covert-way, and ſometimes with a Ditch about this Out-breſtwork, and with <hi>Stakado's.</hi>

                     <p>SOmething of what is now to be ſaid is alſo common to Regular places, but we ſhall conveniently diſpatch them all together in this place.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thoſe places o're which riſing Hills or neighbouring Mountains domineer, are unfit to be fortified. Either therefore the Hill is to be incloſed within the circuit of the walls, or if it cannot be incloſed, all care muſt be taken that the Enemy do not poſſeſs it: Which, will be done by ſetting a new and ſtrong Fortification upon it; or when this cannot be done, it muſt be by raiſing of <hi>Cavaliers</hi> or batteries in the Bulwork or Courtine, o're which the Hill ſeems to hang. If Caſtles or Cities are built upon Mountains where there may be danger of Mining, you muſt fortifie the foot of the Mountain with works.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The moſt convenient and ſafeſt place for the Gates, is betwixt the two Bulworks
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42528:138"/> in the middle of the Courtine, for they can be defended in no other place with ſo much ſecurity and facility. For the ſame reaſon Rivers cutting through a City, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived betwixt the two Bulworks.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To keep great Cities in their duty and obedience, there is nothing fitter than to joyn a <hi>Cittadel</hi> to that place which may moſt command the Town.</p>
                     <p>Concerning their building and ſcituation obſerve this, 1. Let them poſſeſs the ſtrongeſt part of the City; wherefore if there be a Rock or Hill within the Town, there let them be built. So they have done at <hi>Namur, Cambray, Naples,</hi> and other places. 2. Let them be ſet againſt the chiefeſt avenues of the Towns, and let the gates be lyable to their command. 3. Let them be <hi>Pentagons,</hi> for this figure is fitteſt; for the ſquare is weaker, and not ſo capacious: The reſt of the figures above a <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> are larger than needs, and are too coſtly. <hi>Antwerp, Turin, Amiens, Vitri, Phallzbourg, Stenay,</hi> and many other Towns, have Pentagonal <hi>Cittadels; Millain, Perpignan,</hi> and <hi>Caſall,</hi> have <hi>Hexagons; Manheim, Verdun, Blavett</hi> have ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangular ones. 4. They are ſo to be placed that they turn two of their Bulworks towards the Town, three to the field; And ſo that one of the Cou tines of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty A B, meet with the Courtine of the <hi>Cittadel</hi> T, betwixt the two Bulworks C and G, one of which looks towards the City, the other towards the Enemy,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 32.</note> as you have it expreſs'd in the 32 Figure. This laſt is not of little moment, for ſo the Bulwork G is ſtoutly defended from the Courtine of the Town; and the Courtine it ſelf of the Town is ſcowred and defended by the <hi>Cittadel.</hi> From whence it appears, they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much erre, who remove the <hi>Cittadels</hi> far from the Towns. 5. Let them have at leaſt two gates, one towards the Town, another towards the field, to receive in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours upon occaſion. 6. Betwixt the <hi>Cittadel</hi> and the houſes of the Town let there be a plane of a ſufficient bigneſs. <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſhews you an example of a <hi>Cittadel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect with all its numbers; for this commands the City with two Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, with two more ſcowrs the <hi>Scald</hi> that flows by it; and with three, proudly domineers o're the field, and it is furniſhed with all the reſt that my either appertain to its form or ſcituation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ſides of Cities that are waſh'd with Rivers, may be fortified with ſlight works, to wit, with a ſingle External or internal Angles, or with middle defences, terminated with half-Bulworks. You ſhall fortifie the ſides with Hornworks fitted for the place, <hi>vid.</hi> fig. 33. Not only the mouths of Havens,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 33.</note> but the ſides that are longer then ordinary, are to be ſtrengthened with Fortifications. If the city be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the River a Muſquet-ſhot, it muſt be joyn'd to it by building a <hi>Cittadel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Banck oppoſite to the Town, if it be within Muſquet-ſhot, and in a friends Countrey, may be fortified with leſs Works; To wit, with an half ſexangular Star, or with a plain Bulwork. But if it be in an enemies Countrey, or in a friends, out of Muſquet-ſhot, you ſhall fortifie it with half a Regular <hi>Hexagon,</hi> whoſe ſides muſt be protected with Hornworks and other works. You have an example in Fig. 34. The neglect of this was the loſs of <hi>Nimmeghen</hi> on the <hi>Vahal.</hi> Of all this you may ſee farther in <hi>Dogen Lib.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <div type="rules">
                        <head>Theſe few Rules following ſhall put an end to Irregular Fortification, of which there is great uſe in this Buſineſs.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. Let the Irregular Fortification be reduced altogether to a Regular one, or as near it as can be.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Let it be round about as equal as poſſible can be, or equally firm.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. A Fortification that is larger with the ſame circumference, is to be prefer'd before a leſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Sides that bend inwards, that is, thoſe that contain an External Angle, muſt be avoided, becauſe they leſſen the place, and are built at greater expence.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42528:139"/>V. The Bulworks may be Irregular, and unlike; for that ſort of Fortification is counted handſomeſt that is ſtrongeſt.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The leaſt diſtance of the Bulworks (according to <hi>Dogen</hi> pag. 188.) muſt be 60 <hi>Rhynland</hi> perches, the greateſt 80.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The Angle of defence on the Angle of the <hi>Tenailles,</hi> muſt be as oft as can be, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the middle point of the Courtine.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Againſt Hills that hang over the Town, or againſt Rivers that flow into the Moat, rather object the Courtine than the Bulwork, for that is ſtronger than this.</p>

                     <hi>THE THIRD PART.</hi> Of beſieging Towns, and how to defend them.</head>
                  <p>THere are five Acts proper to the Seige; Circumvallation, The Lines of approach and Batteries for Cannons, The Sappes, or the cutting through the out-breſtwork, The Gallerie, and the breaking of the Bulwork by a Mine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, therefore the place that is to be beſieged is to be ſo incloſed round about with a Rampar, fortified with all ſorts of works, that no going out, nor coming in, may lie open to it. 2. You come to the out-breſtwork under the favour of tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches depreſs'd beneath the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and drawn with various windings, ſo that they cannot be ſcowred from any part of the place beſieged. 3. The out-breſtwork in cutting through, you muſt no longer uſe trenches drawn obliquely, but it muſt be done by the ſhorteſt cut, that is by a Line drawn directly. 4. The Graft muſt be fill'd with a bank made of earth and ſtones and Faggots, carried on thorough it to the Rampar, on which at laſt the Gallery is layd. If the Ditch be dry, ſometimes the Gallery is carried under ground to the place appointed for the Mine. 5. Through the Gallery that is now finiſhed, the Pioneers advance without any danger to the Rampar, where they dig a hole, and put in ſuch a quantity of Gunpowder as may ſerve to break the great Bulk of earth that ſtands over it; which at laſt being ſet on fire, and the Rampar broken, the Souldiers are led on through the Gallery to the breach, to enter the City that lyes open before them. This is the Sum of the Siege, whoſe parts I ſhall briefly expound, and every one diſtinctly by it ſelf.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. Let there be ſo many, that relief may be readily ſent from them, to all parts of the Circumvallation.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let them be above Cannon ſhot from the Town, or at leaſt ſo far off, as that they may fear little dammage from their Guns.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Let them be placed, if you can, by a River ſide.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Camp, as likewiſe all the reſt of the Circumvallation, muſt be fortified with Trenches, that is, with a Rampar round about it, and ſeveral other works.</p>

                        <p>THeſe Lines of the Siege are a continual kind of Rampar, which ſurround as wel the Camp, as all the reſt of the places about the Town beſieged. Concerning theſe, Obſerve this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Let them be twofold, one inward, built againſt the beſieg'd, to keep them in, leaſt with their Sallies they hurt the Beſiegers; the other outward, to keep off any enemy that ſhould attacque the Camp from without. Let the outward be ſtronger than the inward; nay, when there is but a ſmall Garriſon in the Town, theſe inward ones may be ſpared, or at leaſt very ſlightly built.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Theſe Trenches, eſpecially the outward one, muſt not be extended above 750 feet upon a right Line: After every 750 feet, they muſt be fortified with ſeveral works caſt before and betwixt them. Theſe are wont to be uſed, Redoubts or little Turrets, Middle or toothed defences, outward and inward Angles, Little Tonges, Stars, ſquare Forts with whole Bulworks, various Forts with half Bulworks, whole plain Bulworks, and half ones, Ravelins, half moons, Hornworks, Crownworks.</p>
                        <p>All this Trade of Works ſo various and ſo manifold, was uſed in no time more than in our age, nor in no place oftner than in <hi>Holland,</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Hartogen Boſch,</hi> at both the Sieges of <hi>Breda, Maſtricht,</hi> and many others; moſt of thoſe are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy delivered in the foregoing propoſitions: we will expound thoſe that remain in the following.</p>

                        <p>THere is a twofold Battery, offenſive and defenſive;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fig.</hi> 42.</note> the laſt is directed towards the enemy without; the firſt towards the beſieged. You ſhall build an Offenſive one after this manner.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Multiply the number of Guns that are to be mounted by 12; the product ſhall give in feet the length of the Battery, for each Gun is diſtant from another 12. feet, and the two at the ends are diſtant from the Breſtwork 6 feet each.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You'l have the, breadth A D, if, to the length of a Gun mounted in his carriage, you add the ſpace A F, ten or twelve feet for the recoiling of the peice; and the ſpace F D, for traverſing and paſſage.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Let the plat-form of the Battery be made ſloaping downwards towards the Enemy, that when the Guns are recoil'd they may with more eaſe be brought back to their places: Let its entry behind be I, K; the way leading to it muſt not be very ſteep, but gently riſing, that the Guns may with more eaſe be got in.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That part of the Battery that faces the Enemy, muſt be fortified with a Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, whoſe Baſe you may make 12, 15, or 18 feet, its height 6; for the ſides A D, B E a leſs width will ſuffice.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Let there be ſo many Ports in the Breſtwork as there are Guns; let their height be three feet, their outward width four, their inward two; the outward width is more than the inward, that the Guns may ſcowr more of the field.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Behind the Battery you muſt deſcribe a ſpace D S N E equal and like the Battery; in it make a ſquare hole, as M, whoſe ſide muſt be ten or twelve feet; in which the powder muſt be kept, and you muſt cover the mouth with leather, leaſt any ſparks ſhould fall in. To conclude, as well about the Battery it ſelf A E, as the ſpace D N, you muſt make a Ditch eight or ten feet wide, ſix feet deep.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The firſt Batteries are wont to be raiſed at a Muſquet-ſhot from the Town, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwads near the very ditches; the general rule may be this, that the nearer they are the place, they do the greater execution.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The Defenſive Batteries are not ſo full of work; their Breſtwork, if it be made of earth, may be ſix or ſeven feet thick; the height is ſufficient, if it cover a Gun in its carriage; inſtead of an earthen Breſtwork they uſe commonly great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Baskets fil'd with earth.</p>

                           </gap>, with the ſame obliqueneſs; and ſo by ſeveral tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings you proceed to the Out-breſtwork it ſelf, where at length the Approaches are finiſh'd, drawing two Trenches <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> longer than ordinary, and parallel to the place beſieged. Theſe two laſt Lines cover the Beſiegers like a Breſt-work, ſo that being ſo near at hand they frighten away the Defendants from guarding their Graft and Rampar.</p>

                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42528:142"/>2. Although the Approaches ought ſo to be carried on, that they may never be ſcowred from the Enemies Rampar, yet the Engineer ſhall take good heed he make them no more obliquer than needs, to the loſs of time and expences. I think with two turnings you may alwayes come to the out-breſtwork, a far ſhorter way than if more oblique lines had been made: For let there be drawn from the point where you began your Approaches, the right line <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which continued may fall a little without the Angle of the breſtwork, and if another line be produced from β, which goes without the Angles of the out-breſtwork, you will arrive at the out-breſtwork in two turnings <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>: but why this way of Approaches is leſs uſed, I think this to be the reaſon: That your long lines of Approach, if attempted, may be ſooner car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and demoliſh'd by the Enemy, than thoſe that are cut in and out with ſeveral windings.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. At the end of every Line you muſt build Redoubts, after ſuch a manner, that two may be flanqued by one; for this is the beſt ſituation of Redoubts: If one of the Lines be drawn longer than ordinary, you may alſo build Redoubts in the middle for its defence, all which the 43 Figure ſufficiently expreſſes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The earth which is caſt out is thrown towards the Enemy, that it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Breſtwork to the Pioneers.</p>
                        <p>Let its Tower width be ſix feet, its upper twelve or fifteen, its leaſt depth muſt be ſuch, that may cover a ſtanding man, with the height of its Breſtwork joyn'd to it. The nearer they advance to the Town tht deeper they muſt be: The width alſo muſt be increas'd, if there is occaſion to bring ſtuff for the Gallery thorough the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: They uſe frequently to make three ſteps to the Breſtwork.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. For the ſecurity of the Approaches, Batteries are to be built in convenient places.</p>

THe Approaches being advanced to the out-breſtwork, two longer Trenches, as I ſaid before, ought to be drawn parallel to the place that is beſieged, the Breſtwork being built towards the Enemy; in theſe Muſqueteers are to be placed, that they may hinder the Enemy from ſhowing his head above the Rampar.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe things being done, when you can no longer draw your Lines oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis neceſſary that from that longer Trench, which is parallel to the place you intend to attaque, you cut a ſtrait Channel L H, commonly called a <hi>Sappe,</hi> thorough the out-breſtwork, to the very ditch of the Fortification. Without doubt this work is full of dangerous chances: But the danger ſeems to be leſſened by theſe means. 1. The Souldiers being placed in the Trenches <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, by their continual firing hindring the Defendants. 2. The Breſtwork and flanques of the Rampar are now ſo batter'd by the Cannon, that the Defendants can ſcarce ſtand upon their Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Channel is made deeper than the reſt of the Approaches, and is cover'd above with boughs, ſtraw, hides, and other things neceſſary; that if a man cannot be protected by it from the ſhot, yet at leaſt the Pioneers may be by this means with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the ſight of the beſieged.</p>

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42528:142"/>4. This Channel is to be directed to that part of the Fortification which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the Mine; wherefore, if you beſiege a Regular Fortification, you muſt not direct it towards the Courtine, or the Angle of the Bulwork, but to either of the faces of the Bulwork; For whoſoever attaques the Courtine, is lyable to ſhot from both the Bulworks, and they very near; and whoſoever attempts the Angle of the Bulwork, is alſo lyable to the ſhot of two Bulworks, though they lye farther off: Whil'ſt he that attaques the face can be hurt but from one only. But if the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine hath not on both ſides its full defence, as it often happens in Irregular places not perfectly fortified, the <hi>Sappe</hi> and the attaque may be carried on to the middle point of the Courtine.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Sappe</hi> L H being advanced thorough the out-breſtwork and covert way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ditch,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fig.</hi> 43.</note> all that remains is that you fill the Ditch with a ſolid bank of earth carried on quite over it, and that the Gallery be built upon this bank.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Ditch whether it be wet or dry is filled with ſtones, boughs, faggots, logs, and with ſacks full of earth; but this Rubbidge that is caſt in muſt be ſo ordered, that the bank may riſe quite over, the Ditch as high as the foot of the Rampar, and have ſuch a breadth that the Gallery may conveniently be ſet upon it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The bank being now finiſhed, there is commonly ſo much earth brought tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the <hi>Sappe</hi> and caſt down on the bank, as may ſerve to make a kind of little hill betwixt the face of the Bulwork and the beſiegers; then caſting, with ſhovels lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than ordinary, the lower part of this heap of earth over the upper, this hill is turned over and over, and is rouled on by degrees to the face of the Bulwork.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This hill being rowled on ſome ſpace, there are two gates erected at a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from one another; which are ſo joyned together with planks, as well on each ſide as at top, that no part of them lyes open. On that ſide which regards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Bulwork ſo much earth is caſt up, as may make it Cannon-proof: The other ſide doth not need ſo much covering. Alſo the upper part will be ſufficiently fortified againſt fire, if it be covered with a foot or a foot and half of Earth. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the reſt of the parts of this Gallery ſhall be continued till they come to the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. The width of theſe gates is either 9 or 10 feet, the height 10 feet, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its beams or timbers 6 or 7 inches, half a foot.</p>

In the univerſal affair of the Siege there is nothing more dangerous than this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: Nevertheleſs the danger ſeems to be leſſened by theſe means. 1. That row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hill of earth betwixt the face of the Bulwork and the Workmen, keeps their front ſafe. 2. The oppoſite flanque, as well that of the Bulwork as that of the Courtine, is ſo battered with Cannon, that the ſide of the Gallery cannot be broken from thence by the Guns of the beſieged. Alſo from the Trenches of <gap reason="foreign">

They ſecure their ſides with faggot which they ſet upon cleftwood, commonly called candleſticks, by which means they eſcape many ſhots, and hide themſelves from the ſight of the Enemie.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. When you come to the place appointed K, there you dig a place to lodg the powder, whoſe height is commonly 6 or 7 feet, the ſide of its baſe 4 or 5 feet; here you put your Barrels of powder ſo as to ſet them cloſe together in the place, for ſo the powder will be all lighted in a ſhorter time; and therefore does it effect the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This alſo experience hath taught us, that the earth of the broken Bulwork will fall towards that part, toward which the greateſt ſpace was left between the Barrels and the Superficies of the place where they are put; therefore if you would have the Earth fall towards the Enemy, you ſhall put the powder nearer the ſide φ N, if to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. One Barrel of powder will blow up 12 feet of earth; hence gather how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Barrels are to be put in. The powder muſt not be long carried in before you intend to put fire to it, otherwiſe it would grow moiſt, and be ſpoyled.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The mouth of the Mine C muſt be diligently ſtopped, only leaving in it a Trunck or hollow pipe full of powder for the Train, reaching the powder in K, that putting a match to it you may blow up the Mine at the time appointed.</p>
                     <p>As for the Attacque it ſelf, which is ordered when the Mine is ſprung and the breach made, I leave that to the Officers and Souldiers, to whom theſe things belong.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THe firſt beginning is to keep the enemy from the Town as far off and as long as you can. Therefore whatſoever without the works can put a ſtop to the Enemy, the Beſiegers muſt poſſeſs and defend as long as they can.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They muſt uſe all their endeavour to hinder the approaches of the Enemy; therefore let them ſally frequently (but warily, leaſt they fall into ſnares to the irreparable loſs of the Town) and rout and kill the Pioneers and Souldiers; Let them throw down the Lines that are finiſh'd, and if they cannot carry away their Guns, they muſt ſpike them up, by driving Nails in their Touch-holes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe outward works which they can keep no longer muſt be retrenched, (ſee what we ſaid before of Retrenchments) but if they are utterly like to be loſt, they muſt be blow'n up together with thoſe that poſſeſs them.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42528:143"/>4. The ſapping of the out-breſtwork muſt be intercepted by a counter and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>Sappe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The filling of the Ditch and the building of the Gallery muſt be hindered at a diſtance by the continual firing of Muſquets, great Guns, hand Granadoes, and other fireworks; nor is there any other way if the Ditch be full of water. But if the Ditch be dry, then they muſt fall upon the builders of the Gallery with handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroaks, as well as with all that which I declared above. And the Gallery it ſelf muſt either be deſtroyed by fire, or blown up with a Mine.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But if notwithſtanding all this, the force of the Enemy prevailing, the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery is brought over to the Bulwork, and the Bulwork it ſelf be undermined. Againſt this plague no remedy remains, but to find out the place of the Mine. To do this they uſe ſeveral practiſes. Some by the motion of Peaſe leaping on a Drum-head well braced, do conjecture at the place of their digging; others boaring a very long Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur into the ground ſuſpected, and applying their ear to it, think to hear the ſtroakes of their digging; others uſe other ways to diſcover it. The moſt certain way is by countermining to ſearch the foundation of the Bulwork. The Mine being found, the powder muſt be carried out; but if the ſtreightneſs of time will not permit, it muſt be wetted, and a paſſage opened for the fire.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Bulworks being blown up, if the Beſieged have no inward works remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the laſt refuge is, that ſince they can no longer reſiſt the Enemy with wall and Rampar, that they ſtop his paſſage with arms and hands as he is breaking in at the breach. Which ſince they are rather the parts of Captains and Souldiers than the Engineers, I leave the reſt to them, and put an end to this treatiſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>For Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Interior Poligon</hi> D F O being given (as in <hi>Fig.</hi> E) firſt draw the Capital Lines A G, K T, and M Q of a ſufficient length. Then by the foregoing Directions, deſcribe a <hi>Fortification</hi> inward upon this <hi>Interior Poligon</hi> (as though it were an <hi>Exterior;</hi>) Which done, continue the <hi>Courtains,</hi> and ſo you have given you the two Lines A C, and K M, which you are to divide equally in the points B, and L. And from thoſe 2 Points to draw the four Lines B D, B F, L F, and L O: As likewiſe from the two points, E and N, you are to draw the four Lines E G, E H, N T, and N Q; ſo as E G, may be parallel to B D, E H to B F, N T to L F, and N Q to L O; Or (which is the very ſame thing) make the <hi>Angle</hi> D E G, equal to the <hi>Angle</hi> A B D; the <hi>Angle</hi> F E H, to the <hi>Angle</hi> C B F; the <hi>Angle</hi> F N T, to the <hi>Angle</hi> K L F; and the <hi>Angle</hi> O N Q, to the <hi>Angle</hi> M L O.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, from the four points of Interſection, <hi>viz.</hi> G, H, T, and Q, draw the Lines G H, and T Q, which are the two <hi>Baſes</hi> ſought; upon which, by the foregoing Method, deſcribe a <hi>Fortification</hi> Inward, and the Work is done.</p>
                     <p>Only whenſoever the <hi>Baſes</hi> (and conſequently the two Faces of a <hi>Baſtion</hi>) do not meet in a point, (as very rarely they will) the <hi>Face</hi> of the leſs <hi>Half-Baſtion</hi> cuts off the <hi>Face</hi> of the greater <hi>Half-Baſtion;</hi> which hath this good property among many other, that it often opens or enlarges the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Baſtion</hi> very conſiderably. Thus in <hi>Fig.</hi> E, the <hi>Face</hi> R H cuts off the <hi>Face</hi> P T in the point S.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing obſervable in the Method both of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Face</hi> of this <hi>Medall,</hi> which is this, That inſtead of taking three Lengths of any Meaſure for the Line <hi>A D,</hi> in <hi>Fig.</hi> C, and then ſetting off (1) for the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> B C, I might divide the <hi>Half-Baſe</hi> A D into 3 or 6, or 9 equal parts, and take ⅓ thereof for the <hi>Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> D E, becauſe the Line D E bears the ſame proportion to the Line A D, as the Line B C doth to the Line A B. So likewiſe, inſtead of taking 15 or 30 Lengths upon the <hi>Half-Baſe</hi> G K in <hi>Fig.</hi> D, for the Line G H, and ſetting off 4 or 8 of thoſe parts in the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> H I, I might as well have divided the <hi>Half-Baſe</hi> G K into 15 or 30, and ſet off 4 or 8 for K L. For as K L is to G K; ſo is H I to G H.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as this laſt way is more difficult and tedious than the other before mentioned, That was made uſe of, and This laid aſide.</p>

Yet notwithſtanding this new Method takes it for granted, That all who pretend to make uſe of it, be ſo far inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the firſt Principles of <hi>Fortification,</hi> as to know, That when ever an <hi>Exterior Poligone,</hi> or rather a Ground-Plot, is given them, they are ſo to deſign and contrive it, That, if poſſible, all the <hi>Baſes,</hi> (if not the <hi>Angles</hi>) may be equal, That ſo there may be a perfect Harmony and Symmetry in all the parts thereof. This new <hi>Rule</hi> does likewiſe ſuppoſe, that he already knows, That, if it be practicable, each of his reſpective <hi>Baſes,</hi> (or <hi>Exterior Poligones</hi>) ought to be about 1150 Feet; but never leſs than 1024. nor yet more than 1280. That ſo the <hi>Lines of Defence</hi> may not be too ſhort on the one hand, nor exceed the Port of a <hi>Muſquet</hi> on the other. As likewiſe, that the <hi>Angle</hi> of his <hi>Baſtions</hi> be in no caſe whatſoever leſs than 60 <hi>Degrees.</hi> But now, where either the ſcituation of a Place, or the old Walls or Ramparts of a Town, or City, admit not any ſuch equality, either of <hi>Baſes,</hi> or <hi>Angles,</hi> there the <hi>Hercotectonick</hi> Laws do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Engineer,</hi> either to open, or ſharpen his <hi>Angles,</hi> or elſe to lengthen, or ſhorten his <hi>Lines,</hi> as he ſhall find it neceſſary.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E will not diſpute of the firſt Invention of Guns, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it came from <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> do report, or from an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> or from a <hi>Monk,</hi> for this knowledge matters not much to the Art, nor is it of any profitable ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the Artiſt; eſpecially conſidering, that Authors do not really conſent in this thing. Our intent is therefore not to trouble the ingenious Students with vain uncertain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but to compoſe a compleat Piece of Gunnery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to diſcourſe from the beginning to the end, all that is neceſſary to be known or learned (after the knowledge of common Arithmetick) by one that intends to be a perfect Proficient in the ſaid Art. We do ſuppoſe it therefore neceſſary for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Gunner to know firſt the making of Molds and caſting of Pieces. Therefore I ſhall firſt begin to diſcourſe of the property and Nature of the Earth fit for caſting, or making Molds; for this is of great moment, conſidering that many, or indeed moſt Earths are not for this purpoſe; for the Earth fit for the caſting of Pieces of Ordnance muſt be ſuch as will not be melted or fuſe, although it be put into a very great fire, but muſt remain firm and hard: and theſe Earths are generally of a Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, or Iron-like colour, which is well known to many Potters, eſpecially ſuch as make <hi>Chymical</hi> Veſſels. The Earth being obtained, it muſt be ſifted and caſt up after the uſual manner, as men do in the making of Morter; then let it be moiſtned with an Alchalated Water (eſpecially ſuch as is made of Niter) for that purpoſe, and make it like paſte; then, as is uſual, let it be beaten up ſtrongly with an Iron Bar; the more 'tis beaten the better it is: in the beating add one ſixt part of Horſe dung, and a proportionable part of Flox or Hair, and let it again be well beaten and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, alwayes keeping a Moity of this Earth, without Hair or Flox, which is for Ground-work; and theſe Compoſitions or Earth thus incorporated, you muſt reſerve for the making your Molds for Pieces of Ordnance, according to the Rules preſcribed in the next Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of making Molds, and Caſting Pieces of Ordnance, with the mixture of Metals, and allowance of Powder for proof.</head>
                     <p>AS a Maſter Builder when he intends the Building a Ship, makes firſt a Mold or Moddel of the ſame; ſo the Maſter Gunner, or he that takes in hand the buſineſs of Caſting Guns, muſt have a form or Model of his Piece intended made of wood, or ſuch other matter he may think moſt convenient, which then being brought to the Founder with an intent to be Caſt, muſt firſt be ſmeered all over with Palm Oyle, or inſtead of that, our Lard or Hogs-greaſe, then firſt cover it over with the ſaid earth thinly, and let it dry leiſurely, then lay on more, encreaſing it to ſuch a thickneſs, as you may judge convenient for your purpoſe; and it muſt be ſo made that it may be taken into ſeveral parts, ſo that the pattern may be taken out, and the Mold again exactly cloſed, and the outſide ſtrengthned with Iron plates as long as the Chace of the Piece is, and hooped together with Iron hoops to knock on and off. Then muſt there be made (with the ſame earth upon a ſquare Bar of Iron, bound round with a Cord that the clay may ſtick well) a form exactly round, of the faſhion of the concave of your Piece (whether you intend it a Cylender or a Chamber-board Piece) proportioned both in length and diameter, and it muſt be placed exactly in the middle of the concave; and when all is well joyned together, be ſure it be well polliſhed and ſmoothed, that the Metal may run the better, and be the clearer from flaws, holes, or clefts.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of your work take care that your Mold be exactly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable as to heighth and ſubſtantialneſs of Metal, according to the nature of the Piece you intend. That is, the Canon double-fortified muſt be ſo caſt that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter at Muzzle be but 7/18 of the Diameter at Britch. The leſſer Cannon at Britch to be ¾ ſo big as the greater Cannon 9/18 at Trunions, and 1/18 at Muzzle, whereas ordinary fortified Cannons have at the Touch-hole 7/8 at the Trunions 5/8 and at the Muzzle 1/8, all leſſer Pieces in that kind have 18/18 at the Touch-hole 25/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>8 at Trunions, and 9/18 at Muzzle; and the ordinary fortified Culverins are fortified every way like the double fortified Cannon, and the leſſer Culverin like the ordinary fortified Cannon in all reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Great care muſt be taken in the Caſting of Pieces of Ordnance, that they be equal every way in proportion of Metals, that is, that the Cylender be in the very middle of the Metal, that it may be truely bored, otherwiſe your Piece will fail the Artiſt that ſhall uſe it, until the error be known.</p>
                     <p>In the next place let the Trunions be exactly placed in a Diagonal line with the Axis of the Piece; and they may be placed in their proper diſtance from the Muzzle and Britch, if you obſerve theſe Rules. Take the length of the bore of the Piece from Muzzle to Britch, divide that meaſure by ſeven, and multiply that ſum that cometh of the Quotient by three, the Product will ſhew you how many inches the Trunions muſt ſtand from the loweſt part of the concavity of the Piece.</p>
                     <p>And farther note, that the Trunions ought to be placed ſo, as ⅔ of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Piece, may be ſeen in that place where the Trunions are ſet.</p>
                     <p>When all additional Patterns, as Britch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be made and Luted in their proper place, all things at pleaſure being neatly added to the pattern, let the Mold then be fixt or placed ſo as is moſt convenient for the pouring in the Metal; ſo when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42528:164"/> the Metal is caſt, the perfect impreſſion will be made upon the ſuperficial part of the Piece, and the Cylender will keep the bore propoſed according to what you have preſcribed, the length of the Piece and its Diameter of the bore may be found by the following Table in the next Chapter. For the Metals generally uſed for thoſe Guns, generally called braſs Guns, they are mixtures, and many times varied as experience will give leave. Some of the chiefeſt do approve of this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, to every hundred Weight of Copper 24 pounds of Tin, and 6 pounds of Lattin. Others to 100 <hi>l.</hi> of Copper, add 8 <hi>l.</hi> of Tin, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> of Lattin. Others to ever 100 <hi>l.</hi> add 20 <hi>l.</hi> of Bell-Metal, which is 25 <hi>l.</hi> of Lead and Tin to every 100 <hi>l.</hi> of of Copper. Some add Tin, Lead, Copper, and <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> together; ſo every one follows ſuch wayes of Compoſition as doth moſt pleaſe his own Experience. The Copper and other better Metals being once melted, the Tin and Lead is added for the better and quicker fuſion; and the higher the Metal is in fuſion, the more ſolid and compact your Metal will run and ſettle. The Lattin doth incorporate and cauſe the Piece to be of a good colour, and the Tin doth ſtrengthen and bind the other matters together. Now a Piece of Ordnance being Caſt, before it comes to Service, it muſt be put to tryal; for which purpoſe there is uſed for proof, according to the weight of the ſhot, about two thirds, or four fifths of that weight in Powder, and for ſmaller Pieces more.</p>

                     <p>IT is neceſſary for him that intends to be a Gunner to underſtand, after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Piece in general, to know and learn every part and member of a Piece of Ordnance; for well underſtanding the ſame take theſe Inſtructions following.</p>
                     <p>All the outſide of the Piece round about is called the ſuperficial part of the ſame, or Surface of the Piece; the Inner part is called the concave Cylinder, and Soul of the Piece.</p>
                     <p>The full length is called the Chaſe of the Piece; ſo much of the Cylinder or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave of the Piece as contains the powder and Shot is called the Chamber or charged Cylinder, the remaining part to the ſmall end of the Gun is called the vacant Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>The Spindle ſtanding out, or Ears by which the Piece muſt hang in the Carriage, is called the Trunions; the ſpace between the Trunions, the gravity of the Center.</p>
                     <p>The Pumel or Button at her Coyl or Britch-end is called the Caſacabel or her Deck, the little hole the Touch-hole, all the metal behind the touch-hole the Breach or Coyl, the greateſt ring at her touch-hole the Baſe Ring, the next ring or circle the reinforced Ring, the next the Trunion Rings, the next before the Trunions is called the Corniſh Ring, the foremoſt next the Muzzle is called the Muzzle Ring, Laſtly, all the rings, Circles, Eminencies, at her Muzzle, and ſo thoſe behind the baſe Ring, are Prizes.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Mounting of a Piece of Ordnance in its Carriage.</head>
                     <p>THe Gunners upon Land-Service, for the conveniency of mounting a piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that is by any means whatſoever diſmounted, have for their principal Services, a Screw, and a Ghynne, and their appurtenances (which you will find in their proper place) by whoſe help they are able to mount a Piece, and place him in his Carriage, whereby he may be able to perform the work intended. Which to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form artificially, obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
                     <p>Before you endeavour to mount your Piece, above all things have a great and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care that the Ghynne be very firmly ſet, ſo that it may not ſlip any way; but ſo placed, that the Pully or Truckle coming down from the head, fall juſt between the Trunions, or gravity of the Piece, whereof to be aſſured you may let fall down from the head of the Ghynne a Plummet with a Line, or for want of a Plummet any ſtone made faſt to a Line, and ſo moving the Ghynne until the ſaid Plummet fall juſt upon the Center of Gravity, which is between the Ears of the Piece, that the metal may fall near equal, or that an eaſie hand may poize it; and this care muſt be the more, if the Ground whereon the Ghynne ſtands be ſandy or looſe Ground, or the Earth be boggy ſoft, ſo that the feet may fail or ſink in or give way, according to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42528:166"/> the greatneſs of the weight. For ſometimes it may be neceſſary to put planks or ſome ſolid thing under the Ghynne and Pins to ſtay them; but this as neceſſity ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>Now the Ghynne firmly placed and ſetled, the Gunner muſt get up by the Ladder, or ſome Steps, to the head or top of it, having the Rope in his hand, ſhall put it through the uppermoſt truckle of the head, and let it fall down to another man again, that he may catch it, that he may put it through one ſide of the Piece to faſten it into the Ears of the Piece, and ſo having put it through them he may draw it up, until he can give it him that is above, and then put it through the other hole of the Truckle, and give it to him that is under him, who muſt reach it again to him that is above, and ſo faſten it to the head of the Ghynne, giving it ſome turns until it come under the uppermoſt Truckle.</p>
                     <p>This done, he muſt faſten it with great diligence to the lower Truckle, by putting the Ears as through the Ring which is under the ſaid Truckle; after this begin to Hoyſe your Peice, and in the Hoyſing put a ſpar or ſome ſuch thing into the mouth of the Peice, ſo that thereby it may be governed, and may not ſway from one ſide to the other, which would be dangerous; for if it ſhould ſtrike againſt the Rouler or any one of the feet of the Gynne, it may break all, and ſo ſpoil both the work and the men tending upon it. Therefore I ſay, be ſure that thoſe who ſtand by the Spar be careful in guiding the Piece and keeping it ſteddy and right, until the weight of the Piece is well ſetled, a diligent Eye being had all this while, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feet of the Gynne, nor Rope give way; and be ſure every part of the Rope draw equal, and that there be no Knicks, or that they be not tangled one amongſt another; and for that purpoſe, when they begin to hoyſe the Piece, blows muſt be given upon the Tackling until it be ſet tort, and all bear equal.</p>
                     <p>But if you ſhould perceive that the Ghynne or any part give way, preſently let your Piece ſink, and underlay and ſettle well the feet of the Ghynne, and that as gently as may be, to the end the Croſs beam or Rouler may not be disjoyned or broken.</p>
                     <p>Then wind it up carefully and very gently by the help of two men onely, and in ſuch a manner, as when one of the Leavers is brought down, it muſt be held there faſt until the other has got purchaſe, and then muſt this other alſo be brought down; this muſt be reiterated ſo often until it be ſo high that the Carriage may be placed under it, ſo that the Trunions may fall into the Sockets, or holes of the Carriage, and then Guide the Piece by the Spar, ſo that it fall eaſily in, and ſo reſt it ſelf in the Carriage, and then let it be well claſped over, and then locked in and faſtned with Forelocks, and ſo you may draw away your Piece where you pleaſe. On board Ships this Ghynne is not of uſe, it being the Boatſwains buſineſs to fix a Tackle that may be able to hoiſt up any Piece into its Carriage, the Slings one part muſt come about the Caſacabel, and the other part about a Billet, ſo made that it may fit in at the Muzzle, and by ſtrength of hands, or by help of a Windleſs, or Capſtain, it may be hoyſed up ſo that the Carriage may be brought under; ſo that the Gun being Loared, its Trunions may fall into the holes of the Carriage, which then claſp over with its Iron Claſps; let them be Forelocked, and then with Hand-Tackles be brought where you pleaſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The way to draw a Piece of Ordnance, with the neceſſary things thereunto belonging both for Land and Sea.</head>
                     <p>SEeing we have diſcovered the way of Caſting a Piece, and Mounting it in its Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, it follows in the next place that in this Chapter we treat of, and ſhew the manner of drawing them from place to place, for Service; where care muſt be taken what the way is that you are to paſs, for if the way be foul, mooriſh, and dirty, there is then required as many more Horſes as in good wayes. That is,</p>
                     <p>For a whole Cannon of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> you may uſe 15 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                     <p>For a Demi-Cannon of about 6000 <hi>l.</hi> you may uſe 11 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                     <p>For a Piece of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> weight, you may uſe 8 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                     <p>For a Field Piece of about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> uſe 6 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                     <p>For a Saker of 1800 <hi>l.</hi> weight, you may uſe 4 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                     <p>For a Piece of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> weight, you may uſe 3 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                     <p>For a Faucon, two couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar. For a ſmall Drake of about 250 <hi>l.</hi> one Horſe will ſerve: and by the ſame Rule you may find how many Horſes will draw any weight whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Many times when Horſes are wanting, men are made uſe of: Upon ſuch occaſions, you muſt divide your men into three drawing files, according to the greatneſs of the Piece; now to the end the Ranks may ſpread, and every man may draw equally alike, faſten to the end of the Carriage a Croſs beam or bar, to which you muſt faſten the drawing Ropes, equally at ſuch diſtance, that one may not impead the other, and let there be beſure one to ſteer the Piece when you come to any winding or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If the drawing Ropes be long, 'tis neceſſary to croſs it with Ropes, or ſome light peeces of wood like a Ladder, with two or more croſs peeces; let them be made faſt for the better and more ſteady drawing, and to every there muſt be a Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line faſtned to the Ropes, and ſo to caſt over every mans Sholders, in manner as is uſed to draw our Weſtern Barges: And you muſt know your proportion of men fit to draw any Piece of Ordnance, and that muſt be regulated according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or badneſs of the way, and ſo more or leſs men, allowing every man to draw about 50, 60, or 80 pounds; for 'tis ſuppoſed a man may draw in ordinary way 50 or 60 pounds, but in very good way more than 80 pounds; however 'tis good to have men enough. Let the Spunge, Ladle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be made faſt along the Piece to the Ring and Britch end. Sometimes by reaſon of the unevenneſs, ſteepneſs, or other defects of the way, it ſometimes happens, that you may be forc'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount your Piece, and remount it again; there 'tis neceſſary every Gunner have with him a Ghynne, a Wynche, and all appurtenances neceſſary thereunto. As to the Sea Gunner on board Ship, their occaſions require no more than the Wynch; and their Piece being mounted according to the directions given in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then with one or two Tackles he bring the Piece to the place deſired, where it ought to be well faſtned in its place; for which purpoſe there is thereunto required Tackles and Britchins; and in caſe of foul weather, or that any of the Geer or Tackling be ſuſpected, or by my much tumbling every thing hanging upon the Nail, for fear any Bolts ſhould give way or draw, it is uſual to nail down to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42528:167"/> Deck with Spikes, one Coyne behind each Truck, or at leaſt the after Trucks, which to great Pieces are commonly dead Trucks; ſo that each Piece may have little or no play.</p>
                     <p>But in caſe any thing ſhould give way in foul weather, then with all ſpeed diſmount the Piece as ſoon as poſſible you can, for fear of further miſchief; for which purpoſe put in his way as he runs from ſide to ſide, Rugs, Pillows, Beds, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and ſtand ready with Crows and Handſpikes, and with Tackles, to hitch or ketch him cloſe and faſt to any Ring by the Ship ſide, or ſuch other place as beſt preſents. As for the length of the Tackles uſeful, it is uſually known thus; ſee how long the Piece is, and make the Tackles four times as long, and let the Britchin be twice the length of the Piece, and ſomething more. The manner of drawing of Pieces by Man and Horſe, you will ſee in the third Figure.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> To Grove or Examine the goodneſs of a Piece of Ordnance, whether it be Flawed, Hony-Combed, Crackt, Chamber-bor'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With the difference of Common, Legitimate, and Baſtard Pieces.</head>
                     <p>IT remains neceſſary for this Chapter to treat, or ſhew the way to know, whether a Piece be ſerviceable or no, which is uſually done in the firſt proof by Powder, which we intend not to Write of here, having mentioned it before, and more will be ſaid, when we have ſhewed the compoſition of Powder. That knowledge of a Piece we here intend, is to examine a Piece, bought, or to be taken into Service, whether good or ſerviceable, or out of many Pieces to make choice of the beſt, or ſuch as are freed from holes, flaws, cracks, honycombs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And firſt to know if a Piece be free from crack, or have holes through, take a long ſtick, longer than the Piece, made of a Hoop-ſtick or otherwiſe, ſlit it at one end, ſo that you may put a ſhort peece of Candle in it, then light the Candle, and put it into the Piece, and ſo putting it along eaſily, whilſt another laying his Eye cloſe to the Piece, do go along equally with the Candle, until the whole Piece be viewed, and ſo by help of the Light within ſide, the Eye without ſide will perceive whether there be any Flaws, Cracks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be done by the reflection of the Sun beams in at the Muzzle of a Piece, by help of a Looking-glaſs, or polliſhed Steel; but many times a Piece may be Flawed or Hony-combed, and cannot be diſcerned through the Piece, and then the beſt way to find them out is thus; make the uſual ſearch with two or three Springs, or in caſe you have them not, bend the Iron point of a Half Pike, then put it into the Piece up to the Britch end or bottom of the Cylinder, turning it round carefully and gradually, as you pluck it out, and if there be any Honey-combs, Cracks or Flawes, the end or bended point of the Half Pike will ſtick or catch at them.</p>
                     <p>To know whether the Piece be Chamber-bor'd, take a priming Iron that is ſmall, or a piece of Wire, bend it a little at the end, but ſo that it may go down at the Touch-hole, and put it down ſo far as it will go; Then at the Touch-hole cloſe by the Metal of the Piece, make a mark upon the Wire; then gently pluck it up upon one ſide of the Touch-hole, until the bended point ſtop upon the Metal or upper ſide of the Chamber; and then make another mark upon the Wyer, juſt by the Touch-hole;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42528:167"/> then draw out the Wyer, and the diſtance between theſe two marks, is the height of the Chamber or bore of the Piece at Britch: take the height of the bore at Muzzle, and if this height at Muzzle agree with that taken at the Britch of the Piece, then is the Piece full bored; but if they differ, ſo much as the difference is, ſheweth the tapering of the Piece, and according to this muſt your former be made for your Cartredges. There is another way to know whether a Piece be Chamber-bor'd, or Tapering, by the diſparting of a Piece; which way we ſhall ſhew in its proper place, where we treat of diſparting a Piece of Ordnance.</p>
                     <p>Now although we have mentioned in the former Chapters the moſt uſual Pieces of Ordnance; yet, as I have ſaid, there are other Pieces which are longer, or ſhorter, which are uſed, and are generally called by the name of Baſtard Pieces, and they are diſtinguiſhed from the common Legitimate Pieces thus; The Legitimate Pieces have their due length of Chace, and are proportioned according to the true height of their bore. Baſtard Pieces are ſhorter Chaſes, ſuch as the proportion of their bore doth require, and are therefore called Cuts of the ſame nature of the Piece they agree with in the bore; as thoſe of Demi-Culverin bore, are called Demi-Culverin Cuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are alſo Pieces called Extraordinary, which are ſuch whoſe Chaces are longer than is uſually for that bore.</p>
                     <p>Now we have well and duely underſtood how, not only to make, but alſo to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and prove a Piece of Ordnance; in the next place ſhall follow their uſe, ſet down in due order: Wherein firſt 'tis neceſſary for us to treat of the nature of Gun-powder, and its various Compoſitions, with the Materials neceſſary thereunto, and afterward ſhew its uſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Materials uſed in the Compoſition of Gun-powder; and firſt we will treat of the Original of Salt-Peter.</head>
                     <p>IT is believed by many in theſe latter times, that the Salt-Peter now in uſe, is not the Niter of the Ancients, but a new Invention uſed or found our for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Powder; And that theirs was only a Niter generated by nature, or that Salt that is coagulated of it ſelf, without any humane Artifice, in the Caverns of the Earth, from whence they took it which nevertheleſs they divide into four different Species, to wit, <hi>Armenian, Affrican, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian;</hi> and this <hi>Egyptian</hi> holds its name by a certain Region in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which is found great abundance. <hi>Serapian</hi> delivers to us, that the places from whence they drew their Niter were all one and the ſame, like them where common Salt is formed, in which the water running doth congeal, and condenſeth like a vulgar Stone, from hence came it to be called ſtonified Salt, or Sal-Peter. The ſame Author doth affirm, that Niter was found of divers colours, <hi>viz.</hi> White, Reddiſh, Livid, or Lead-like, and all other colours it was able to take; he ſaith likewiſe that it was found in different forms; for ſome was found full of holes or caverns like a Spunge; others on the contrary were firm, cloſe, ſollid, ſhining, and Diaphanous as Glaſs, which being let fall eaſily will ſplit in thin leaves, and is fryable in beating; and from its various appearances is judged its manifold vertues, in one more powerful than another, which is known by its operation.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42528:168"/>
                     <p>From hence we ſee that which is to be found from the teſtimony of the beſt received Authors about the Mineral Niter, and in none is any mention made of Artificial Salt-Peter, or ſuch as we at preſent make uſe of generally, which is called properly <hi>Salt-Peter, Sal Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Halinitre;</hi> yet is there very little difference between the Natural that uſeth to be brought to us, and the Artificial, for if we compare the vertues and operations of the one, we ſhall find them in our uſes no way d ffering, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> teſtifies, ſaying that the ancient Niter is not much different from ours, particularly if we conſider its tenuity and ſubtil part.</p>
                     <p>There is of the ancient Niter found upon the ſuperficies of old Walls, expoſed to the humidity; but particularly in Cellars and deep Caves, and in covered Vaults; it reſembles perfectly a certain Brine, or white Gelly, or fine Meal, or in more proper ſpeaking, fine Sugar, and is many times white as Snow; and this thus had, the vertues are to be commended, which I my ſelf have taken the pains to collect, in the imitation of many others which I have often ſeen; which if now it be deſired to prepare this Salt according to the method, of our Art; It will be congealed into ſmall little long Chriſtals like Iſicles, and it will be like that of the Ancients. But as 'tis impoſſible to find ſo great a quantity, as the continual uſe doth conſume, and neceſſity doth excite to this day for the ſupply of all Wars, which have been great, and in few years conſumed many great and vaſt places of the Univerſe: We are therefore conſtrained to this new ſubject, and are forced even to ſtudy and invent in theſe latter ages a new way to ſupply the want of the former, which being made with much labour and induſtry from the bowels of the Earth, and then purified and waſhed divers times to ſeparate it from its more groſs and Terreſtrial parts, and taken from its firſt crudity, that its may ſhew its likeneſs of its Mother, it is in the end perfectly purified and brought to ſuch a height, that it differs nothing to he of the ſame form and vertue of the ancient Salt-Peter.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if I may be admitted to ſpeak my thoughts upon it, I ſhall ſay openly and plainly, leaving none in doubt, the Ancients did indeed find natural growing Niter, which came out of it ſelf at the tops of Rocks, filling the clefts and holes, and there condenſing into ſmall Icicles, it hardens and petrefies. This Niter is natural; but ſince Art is the Imitator of Nature, as 'tis allowed by all, then you may not think it ſtrange, if we can by a little of her aid, and by force of induſtry, attain to the perfection of her productions; nay, (if I may be bold to ſay it) ſuch as ſhall ſurpaſs by far, the more perfect of her works. Do we not daily ſee an infinite of very principal Works brought to light, after a long and painful travel, which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nature to imitate, although ſhe did imploy at the beſt all her ſecret and full ſtrength to come to perfection. It may from hence herefore be concluded that our Salt made by the Art of Fire, is ſuch as is every way agreeing with that of the Ancients, not any way differing one from the other; eſpecially as to thoſe uſes we intend here. For if according to our method given in the next Chapter, I dare affirm, in all our uſes it will truely imitate the natural, but the more, if it be purified and purged many times: So that at laſt it will come to be more excellent than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and natural Salt-Peter; which is plainly ſeen in the ordinary way of purifying Common Salt or Sugar, which by Art is ſo purged, that it comes to be far purer and whiter than 'twas before, in its firſt natural dreſs. And this we do ſuppoſe to be a ſufficient argument, or reaſon, for us to judge that our Artificial Salt-Peter is not only as good, but far more excellent than the natural: Which being thus allowed, we will add only a few words of the properties of Niter, and ſo paſs to its Artificial preparation. And firſt of the ſpetting quality and noiſe it makes in the fire, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> would have to be cauſed by its terreſtrity that it holds in it ſelf, which we cannot allow of, but rather judge otherwiſe; for if the Earthy part were the ſubject that made it make ſuch noiſe, then the Earth it ſelf might be adjudged to make a far greater noiſe, ſeeing it is alſo mixed with this Element, and yet we find it cracks not at all, being put in the fire; therefore by conſequence this reaſon is void. Well then, is it of its rarity, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>. This cannot paſs for a truth, ſince daily experience doth let us ſee that the Muſhrooms,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42528:168"/> or Toad-ſtools, and many other things which are of a moſt rare thin nature, yet make no noiſe when put upon burning coals. Neither is the hardneſs that is joyned to theſe more ſubtil parts, the cauſe of the cracking; For we ſee that the Pumice-ſtone will not ſpet nor crack, nor make any noiſe in the fire, although it be of a ſubſtance ſufficiently ſpungy and hard. There muſt therefore be another thing that muſt be the cauſe of this ſpetting, and all the noiſe that is made by Nitre, when it is embraced by the fire. The Divine <hi>Praeceptor,</hi> in the 11 Section of his Queſtions ſaith, that the Salt cracks in the fire, becauſe it contains in it much moiſture, which being attenuated by the fire, and rarified in a high degree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts all into Spirits, and an Airy nature; For in it there is contained more of a Spirit, than watery matter, which being brought to the fire, the two fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits mutually attract each other, and joyning together, do become Maſter of the leſſer part the Water; for the fire of the Niter being fortified and put into action by the common fire, the Water is conſtrained from its bonds, and can ſtay no longer there, but muſt of a ſuddain depart, and in its way, by the violency of its departure, overthroweth all ſuch obſtacles as come in its way: And in this action the external air being ſtrongly and violently agitated, by their refraction, it breaks with impetuoſity or great violence, and from thence by conſequence follows that hideous and fearful noiſe which commonly and ordinarily happens, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion of Salt-Peter, and other Compoſitions mixed with it, whereof Salt-Peter is the greateſt part.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The way of Preparing Salt-Peter from a Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Earth.</head>
                     <p>THe Earth and matter of Salt-Peter is found commonly in great abundance, in obſcure ſhadowed places, where no Rain nor any freſh water doth penitrate, nor likewiſe where the Sun by his rayes can communicate his heat; it is likewiſe drawn from Horſe dung under Stables, and from covered places where great and ſmall Cattle are ſhut up; likewiſe in ſuch places as men uſe to piſs in, or Jaqueſes, or the like places; or in places where has been made great Fights, or where has been laid up together many dead Bodies, and earth thrown upon them: For from thence in few years may much Salt-Peter be drawn. I ſhall declare three ſeveral wayes whereby to ground your judgment with more certainty, concerning the goodneſs of the place from whence one would draw the Salt-Peter, which is moſt neceſſary to be known by all Salt-Peter men, or ſuch as intend to mannage theſe Affairs.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that ſuch Earth as you ſuſpect to hold Salt-Peter, be put upon the Tongue, and if it prick a little ſharply, it is a moſt certain ſign you will not looſe your labour in taking it to task; but on the contrary if it be not biting, or a little corroſive, it will not well anſwer your money and labour in preparing of it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way to know a good Nitrous Earth is this: make a hole in the Earth with a ſharp pointed thing, either of Wood or Iron, and in it put a peece of Iron red hot; after having ſtopt the hole, let it ſtand until it be quite cold, then draw it out, and if you find a little after about this Iron ſome Citrine marks, inclining a little after to a whiteneſs, you need not doubt that earth; but further aſſure your ſelf 'tis very good to put to work.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42528:169"/>
                     <p>The third way is, throw a little of that Earth upon burning Coals, and if you perceive it make any noiſe, and that it ſpets in the fire, or that clear and ſhining ſparks come from it, you may from thence judge that that Earth holds a forcible matter of that nature.</p>
                     <p>After you have found a proper Earth to draw Salt-Peter from, and that by ſome of theſe proofs you have teſtimony of its goodneſs and worth, let be taken of it a great quantity, or as much as you pleaſe; let it be carried to a place appointed for this purpoſe, then prepare to burn a good quantity of Wood, either of Oak, Aſh, Elm, Maple, or other ſorts of hard Wood, that you may have Aſhes; then take two parts of theſe Aſhes, one part of quick Lime, mix them well, and put this mixture by it ſelf, for ſuch uſes as I ſhall ſhew you anon.</p>
                     <p>Take then Veſſels of Wood, or Pipes, or Hogſheads cut in two parts, for they muſt be able to hold a good quantity of Water, make a hole at the bottom about one or two fingers breadth, put into the hole a ſmall wicker thing, or you may whelm over it an Earthen Diſh, after put Ruſhes all over the bottom (not excepting the hole) or in its place clean ſtraw; this Veſſel being thus fitted, diſpoſe of it in this manner; Set it ſo, that under may ſtand a leſſer Veſſel of Wood to receive the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that ſhall diſtil down from the upper Veſſel; after put into the upper Veſſel about the height of a hand of this Salt-Peter Earth, which has been before for ſome time dryed in the Air; upon this Earth put the height of three or four fingers of the mixture made of Aſhes and quick Lime, and then again of the Salt-Peter Earth, after of the Aſhes about the ſame height as before; and continue this faſhion, putting Earth upon Aſhes, and Aſhes upon Earth, until the Veſſel be full within a hands breadth at the top, to hold the Water that is put in; this done put upon it freſh Water as much as ſhall be neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo much as muſt ſurmount the Earth two or three fingers breadth, and look that it paſs through all the Earth, and run drop by drop through the hole at bottom of the Veſſel into the Tub ſtanding under, and you ſhall have a Nitrous <hi>Lixivium,</hi> according to the quantity of Water as you poured into the Veſſel; which if you judge is too little, you muſt reiterate the infuſion, and the ſecond time alſo the water paſſing through the Earth will carry with it a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; And ſo the third time.</p>
                     <p>This done, put all the <hi>Lixivium</hi> into a Kettle of a ſufficient bigneſs, and let it be boyled upon the fire very eaſily, and moderately at firſt; after increaſe the fire to the conſumption of the Liquor, or a little more, keeping continually skimming it all the time it boyls. And when 'tis thus conſumed, pour it into wooden Veſſels that are broad, and cover them over with Cloaths, and let them ſtand until the pure part Chriſtalize into white Salt, and the feculent or more terreſtial part ſettle to the bottom. In the mean time continue pouring in of the <hi>Lixivium</hi> again into the Kettle, boyling and skimming it as before; and this do until all your <hi>Lixivium</hi> be boyled up and poured into wooden Veſſels to Chriſtalize.</p>
                     <p>Then from the wooden Veſſels, inclining them gently, pour all the <hi>Lixivium</hi> (leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſettling at bottom by it ſelf) into your Copper as before, and boyl it up again with a good fire until half be conſumed, or until it begin to thicken, or until by putting a little upon a ſtone or peece of board, it do immediately congeal.</p>
                     <p>Then take it from the fire, and when 'tis a little cooled, pour it as before into wooden Veſſels or Boles, and put into each about a hand in height; then cover each Veſſel with courſe cloaths, put it into a cool place, and two or three dayes after you will find your Salt-Peter congealed and thruſt together in ſmall Chriſtals, like tranſparent Ice, ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel, and likewiſe upon ſome ſticks for that purpoſe, provided the rinds being taken off and placed in the wooden Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pouring in of the Liquor; get diligently together the Peter, as well that which ſticks to the ſides of the Veſſel, as that to the ſticks, in a Veſſel of wood proper to receive it, and cover it, and keep it dry. The remaining water you muſt boyl up, as before, not forgetting to ſeparate it from its reſidence.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt 'tis boyling, it happens ſometimes that the Liquor may riſe and boyl over the Cauldron; to prevent that danger, have in readineſs other <hi>Lixivium,</hi> made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42528:169"/> of three parts of Aſhes, and one part of quick Lyme, as we ſpoke before, in which is diſſolved <hi>Roch Allum,</hi> allowing to every hundred weight of <hi>Lixivium,</hi> four pounds of Allum; and when it begins to riſe, pour in a little of this from time to time; And by this means you will ſee that the water that was haſtning to come over, will fall down; and that the common Salt and more terreſtrial part will ſettle to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>The Earth remaining in the Wooden Tubs from whence the ſalt was drawn, muſt be put in ſome cover'd place made for that purpoſe, where neither Sun, Rain, nor any other water may come; and there it muſt be ſpread all abroad about a foot high: Then you muſt have in readineſs Horſe dung or the Excrements of all ſorts of Beaſts, great and ſmall, and put off this upon the other, about the height of three or four foot; then take all that was skum'd from the <hi>Lixivium</hi> in boyling, and the water that is left and will not ſhoot, and the bottoms that are left in the wooden Veſſel, where the Salt-Peter did ſhoot, and throw them away, as hurtful and uſeleſs, upon the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil; throw likewiſe every day, or as often as you can, the Urine of men, and let it lye two years, and you ſhall have your Earth filled with Salt-Peter as before, with a greater aboundance: You may likewiſe throw upon your Dunghill, the Horns, Claws, and Hooſs of Beaſt, and then from this Earth it will be very eaſie to draw good Salt-Peter by the method we have preſcribed.</p>

                     <p>Salt-Peter may be purified thus; put your Salt-Peter in a Veſſel of Copper, Iron, or Verniſh't Earth (I like a Crucible beſt) which being put to a ſmall fire, augment it gradually until all the Salt be melted and boyl'd; then take common Sulphur finely pulveriſed, and throw it upon the liquified Salt-Peter, which will quickly take fire and burn, and by the ſame means conſume all the groſs and viſcous humours, with the terreſtrial Salt remaining uſeleſs amongſt the Salt-Peter, before the rectification; beſides you may reiterate this work by putting on freſh Sulphur many times, until ſuch time all the ſtrange humours be quite conſumed; in the end, the Salt-Peter being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42528:170"/> well melted and well purified, pour it upon well poliſhed Marble or Plates of Iron, or Copper, or glazed Earth, and let it cool, and you will have a Salt-Peter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, almoſt reſembling in colour and hardneſs the true Alabaſter.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> How to clarifie common Sulphur, and to know its goodneſs.</head>
                     <p>WE experience often, and without contradiction, that not only Salt-Peter is filled with terreſtrial qualities, but Brimſtone alſo, which is not only of a fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; certain oleganious humour, but likewiſe a noyſome quality which is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, common to one and the other of its matters; from hence (if we deſire to be curious in our work) we judge it may be neceſſary to purifie Sulphur, and to procure to it by power of clarification, a nature moſt ſublime, ſubtile, fiery and volatile. The order and method that ought to be uſed in this, is thus; in Veſſels of Iron or Copper, melt your Sulphur with a very gentle fire over Coals, well lighted, and not flaming; and when it is melted with a Ladle, skim neatly off all that riſeth on the top and ſwimmeth upon the Sulphur; then not long after, let it be taken from the fire, and ſtrained through a double Linnen Cloath into another Veſſel, pouring it through at leiſure; thus all the Oylie matter and craſſy ſubſtance remains in the Cloath; but under in the Veſſel will be a pure Sulphur, ſuch as we have before ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>To know the goodneſs of Sulphur you muſt do thus: Preſs it between two Iron plates, that are hot, and if in the running it appear yellow, without any bad odour, and that which remains be of a reddiſh colour, one may believe 'tis natural and excellent; ſo likewiſe 'tis a good ſign, if when 'tis ſet on fire, it do freely burn all away, leaving little or no reſident matter. For if Sulphur be pure and good, we do find that there is ſuch a ſympathy between it and fire, that the fire is deſirous of the Sulphur for its nutriment, and that reciprocally the Sulphur is pleaſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be thus devoured and conſumed by the Element of fire; ſo that if ſome fragment of it be put about ſome pieces of Wood, if this ſhall feel the fire at ſome diſtance, it ſeems as if it did attract it to it ſelf, and doth ſometimes unawares at a diſtance catch or take fire, if great care be not taken.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain kind of Sulphur which will not burn ſo freely as other Sulphur, nor ſend forth any ill ſcent, but being put upon the fire, melts no otherwiſe than common Wax; and this Sulphur is found abundantly near Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> as <hi>Carniola</hi> of <hi>Libavius</hi> reports, in his firſt Book of the <hi>Apocap. Hermel.</hi> but this Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is commonly red, as alſo is that which is found in the <hi>Heil des Heim</hi> (as <hi>Agricola</hi> mentions in his firſt Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.) And upon the teſtimony of <hi>John John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Adm. Nat. Claſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. Sulphur is found likewiſe of divers other colours, as pale, Yellow, Green, as is many times to be ſeen and found ſticking about Stones and Rocks: So, that a man may, without any great difficulty, take it from thence, and make it into a Maſs.</p>
                     <p>That which is clear, perfectly yellow, not very hard, nor too much ſhining, is the very beſt. Yet there is another Sulphur which looks greeniſh, and hath never paſt the fire; and this is called <hi>Sulphur Vivum,</hi> and by ſome <hi>Virgin Sulphur,</hi> by reaſon Women and Maids had a cuſtom to compoſe with it a certain <hi>fucus</hi> or Paint, with which they uſed to adorn their faces.</p>

                     <p>THe wayes of Compounding of Gun-Powder have been ſo commonly known, that not only ſuch as are converſant in fireworks do underſtand the ſame, but others alſo; ſo that it is made a particular Trade: nay, that which is more ſtrange, the Countrey people in <hi>Polonia</hi> have learned to prepare it with their own hands, without the uſe of any Artificial Engine, or Chymical Veſſel. For I have ſeen many of the People of <hi>Podolie,</hi> and the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krains,</hi> which we call now the <hi>Coſſaques,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Powder quite contrary to the common way, or that which is uſed by Fire-Maſters. For they put Sulphur, Salt-Peter, Charcoal, all together in an Earthen Pot, a certain proportion of each; (which proportion one to the other they have learned by experimental practice) upon which they pour fair freſh water, which they boyl upon the fire until all the water is evaporated, and the matter become thick; then
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42528:172"/> they take it from the fire, and dry it in the Sun, or in ſome warm place, as a Stove, or the like; then they paſs it through a Hair Sieve, and reduce it into ſmall Grains. There are others that take theſe Materials, and grind them upon a ſmooth flat Stone, or a ſmooth Earthen Diſh, and then having moiſtned it, by their Skill they bring it into Grains; which powder brought to this degree of perfection, they ſerve their occaſions with as much utillity and profit, as if it had been made by the hand of one of the moſt knowing or skilful Powder-makers in the world.</p>
                     <p>It is in my judgment, labour loſt to ſpeak more of theſe ſuperficial wayes; but come to the order and method which is neceſſary and uſually obſerved in the preparing of Gun-Powder: It ſhall likewiſe ſuffice me to propoſe in this Chapter ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions moſt excellent and beſt approved; which are theſe,

                     <p>You muſt firſt finely powder theſe compoſitions or mixtures, for Cannon or Muſquet Powder, and after moiſten them with fair freſh water or Vinegar, or with <hi>Aquavitae;</hi> but if you will have your Piſtol Powder ſtronger and more violent, you ought to ſtir it up ſeveral times whilſt tis in the Morter, with this following liquor; that is, a water diſtilled from Rinds of Oranges, Citrons, or Lemons, by an Alymbeck, or any other Chymical Veſſel; then let all be beaten and well brayed 24. hours, and then in the end reduce it into very fine ſmall grains.</p>
                     <p>A Liquor for this purpoſe may likewiſe be made of twenty parts of <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and 12 parts of diſtilled Vinegar made of Whitewine, and four parts of Spirit of Salt-Peter, and two parts of water of Sal-armoniac, and one part of Camphire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Brandy-wine, or reduced into Powder with powdered Sulphur, or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Oyl of ſweet Almonds.</p>
                     <p>To Corn Powder well, you muſt prepare a Sieve with a bottom of thick Parchment, made full of round holes; then moiſten the Powder that muſt be corned with its water, and make it up in Balls as big as Eggs; which put into the Sieve, and with it put a wooden Bowl, and when you have ſo done, ſift the Powder ſo, as the Bowl rouling about the Sieve, may break the Clods of Powder, and make it paſs through thoſe little holes into Corns.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved by Fire-Maſters and Gunners, that Powder when it is Corned, is of much greater force and power, than in Meal; from hence 'tis concluded, that powder when 'tis put into a Piece of Ordnance, ought not to be preſſed or beaten home too hard in the Piece; for thereby it will looſe its form of grains, and thereby looſeth a great part of its ſtrength that it had, and is therefore not able to throw out the Bullet with ſo great a violence, as if the Powder had been gently thruſt home to the Britch end.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the ſeveral Colours which are to be given to Powder.</head>
                     <p>KNow firſt that all the blackneſs which you ſee in Gun-powder comes from the Coal; not that this colour is abſolutely neceſſary to be conjoyned to its nature, or that it is abſolutely neceſſary to be given to it, for its meliorating or making it more vigorous; this is not ſo; but by contraryes you may be permitted to give unto it any ſuch colours as you ſhall think fit, without prejudice or hinderance of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and vertue of it. For if inſtead of Coal you take rotten dryed wood, or Sawduſt well dryed, or white paper moiſtned and dryed in a Stove and powdered, or indeed any other thing of a combuſtible nature, or that is well diſpoſed to take fire (ſuch as you read hereunder) and to this you may add a colour according to your fancie and pleaſure; and you will infallibly have a Powder that will make the ſame Effect as the black powder. And for this purpoſe I ſhall lay down in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certain mictions, with which I ſerved my ſelf many times, and therefore known to be experimental truths.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>White Powder.</label> Take Salt-Peter ſix pounds, Sulphur one pound, of Sawduſt of the Elder Tree well dryed and powdered one pound, theſe mixed according to the directions in the former Chapter, there will be made a Powder of a white colour. Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Take Salt-Peter ten pounds, of Sulphur one pound, of the woody part when the Hemp is taken away, one pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Salt-Peter ſix pounds, Sulphur one pound, of Tartar calcin'd until it be brought to a whiteneſs, and the Salt extracted for uſe, one Ounce.</p>

                     <p>THere are ſeveral that do Write many ſtrange things concerning this Still Powder, or Powder, without noiſe, or as ſome do give it the name, Deaf Powder, whereof they have treated prolixly; the which I think not convenient to do, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I am loath to tire the Reader with any ſuch Diſcourſe, as tends not much to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: I ſhall therefore put down certain mixtures, which I have known to be more excellent and beſt approved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Firſt way,</label> Take Common Powder two pounds, <hi>Venus Borax</hi> one pound; theſe being well powdered, mingled and incorporated together, muſt be made up into Corn Powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Second way,</label> Take common Powder two pounds, <hi>Venus Borax</hi> one pound, of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> half a pound, of Sal-armoniack half a pound; powder and mix them well, and make them up into Grains.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Third way,</label> Take common Powder ſix pounds, of Live Moles burnt in an Earthen Pot, of <hi>Venus Borax</hi> half a pound, mix them as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>To theſe known things, I ſhall add here a thing whereof you may make experience if you pleaſe; it being only taken from the Books of Authors, without any tryal made by me; which you may alſo find written in the natural Magick of <hi>John Baptiſta Porta,</hi> which is in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, where he ſaith, that if you add burnt Paper in the Compoſition of Gun-Powder, or the double quantity of Hay ſeed well beaten; theſe will take away a great part of the ſtrength, and will hinder it from making ſo great flame and noiſe.</p>
                     <p>Some do ſay that the Gall of a Pike doth the ſame effect, if it be mixed and mingled with the ſame; but we ſhall leave the belief of theſe things to the faith of ſuch Authors as have experimented the ſame.</p>

                     <p>There are ſome wiſe and knowing men in this Art, attribute the cauſe of this noiſe, or as ſome do expreſs it, this horrible noiſe, produced by a Cannon after the firing, not to the Powder, but to the beating and contuſion of the Air which is inraged, or in a paſſion, by being ſo furiouſly endeavoured to be ſtifled or choaked by a ſtrange and extraordinary movement, of which we have ſpoken more at large in the former Chapter, where we treated of Salt-Peter. Yet in favour of the Sons of Art, we ſhall nevertheleſs give you the opinion of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> taken out of his his fifteenth Book, in his <hi>Exer.

                     <p>IT is accuſtomary for men skilled in theſe Arts, to try Powder three ſeveral wayes; that is, by ſight, by touch, and by fire: And firſt, for the tryal by ſight; it is thus,</p>
                     <p>If the Powder be too black, it is a manifeſt ſign of too much humidity, or too much coal; now if it contain too much, as you ſuppoſe, rub it upon white Paper; if it black the Paper more than other good Powder uſe to do, it is a ſign there is more coal in it than ought: for ſuch Gun-Powder as is of a fair azure colour, or a little obſcure, ſomthing bordering upon red, is the beſt ſign, and the moſt aſſured teſtimony of good Powder.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Gun-Powder its goodneſs is known by the touch, in this manner, cruſh ſome Corns under your fingers ends, and if they eaſily break and return to Meal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſting the touch, or without feeling hard, you may aſſure your ſelf from thence, that your Powder hath in it too much Coal.</p>
                     <p>If by preſſing it a little hard under your fingers upon a ſmooth hard board, or upon a ſtone, you feel amongſt it ſmall grains harder or more ſollid than the reſt, which do in a manner prick the ends of the fingers, and do not yield to the finger but very difficultly, or hardly, you may infer from hence that the Sulphur is not well incorporated with the Salt-Peter, and by conſequence the Powder is not well and duely prepared.</p>
                     <p>You may draw infallible proofs or conjectures of the goodneſs of Powder by its burning, if after you have made little heaps of Powder upon a clean and even Table, diſtant one from another about a hands breadth, you then put fire to one of them only; and if it take fire alone, and burn all away without lighting the others, and make a ſmall thundring noiſe, or make a white clear ſmoak, and that it riſe with a quickneſs, ſuddainly, almoſt imperceptible, and if it riſe in the Air like a circle of ſmoak, or like a ſmall Crown; this is an infallible ſign the Powder is good, and perfectly well prepared.</p>
                     <p>If after the burning of the Powder there remain ſome black marks upon the Table, this then ſignifies that the Powder contains too much Coal, which has not been enough burnt.</p>
                     <p>If the board looks greaſie, then the Sulphur and Salt-Peter is not enough cleanſed, and by conſequence it retains much of their terreſtrial matter and oyly natures which were naturally conjoyned to their matters. If you find ſmall grains, white and Citrine, it is a teſtimony that the Salt-Peter is not enough cleanſed, and by conſequence it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42528:174"/> retains much of its terreſtrial matter, and of common Salt, and beſides, the Sulphur hath not been well powdered, nor ſufficiently incorporated with the two other matters of its Compoſition.</p>
                     <p>If two or three Corns of Gun-Powder be laid upon a Paper, diſtant about a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bredth one from the other, and you put fire to them, if the fire be good and ſtrong, they will fire at once, and there will remain no groſsneſs of Brimſtone, or of Salt-Peter, nor any thing but a white ſmoaky colour in the place where they were burnt, nor will the Paper be touched. If ſmall black knots, which will burn downward in the place where proof is made, remain after firing, they do ſhew that the Gun-powder hath not enough of Peter, and that it is of little force or ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Good Gun-Powder will not burn your hand, if it be ſet on fire there.</p>
                     <p>Gun-Powder that is very ſharp or eager in taſt, is not well purified, and will turn moiſt.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt many ſorts of Powder, to know the beſt, make a little heap of every ſort at a diſtance one from another; obſerving well when you fire each heap, which of them doth ſooneſt take fire, for that which ſooneſt takes fire, ſmoaks leaſt and cleareſt, and riſeth quickly up cloſe and round, and leaves little or no ſign behind it, is the beſt Powder.</p>
                     <p>There are Inſtruments likewiſe invented for the tryal or proof of Powder, which the moſt part of Fire-Maſters and Gunners are accuſtomed to uſe, which are deſcribed at large by other Authors; therefore we ſhall not here repeat the ſame; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering likewiſe, that we have found by experience a great fallacy in the ſame, for that one and the ſame Powder, in the ſame meaſure and quantities, hath raiſed the cover to different degrees of height.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> To fortifie weak Powder, and amend that which is ſpoiled, and bring it to its full ſtrength again; and to preſerve good Powder from decaying.</head>
                     <p>WE call ſuch Gun-Powder weak, which hath much degenerated from its firſt ſtrength, and the force which it did acquire in its firſt preparation; as ſuch as hath taken wind, wet, or air; for theſe do diminiſh the quantity of Salt-Peter, and actually ſeparate the Sulphur and Coal.</p>
                     <p>There are two different wayes that theſe accidents do happen; that is, by being many years made, or lying in a moiſt place long; for in time the Salt-Peter alters and ſeparates it ſelf, being naturally ſubject to alter, and return into its firſt matter; for Salt-Peter in its beginning or original being engendered of water, or of a certain Saline humour, no otherwiſe than other Salts are produced of their own proper Brines, doth at laſt, or in a long time, ſeparate it ſelf from the Coal and Sulphur, and ſo return to a Brine water again, as it was in the original, and ſo aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons the other two matters that adhered to it, the Sulphur and Coals looſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their weight, ſeeing that no humidity that is attracted, can be able to diſſolve them; but rather by the contrary, the Coal doth attract greedily, and becomes more ponderous.</p>
                     <p>If for the reaſons aforeſaid you deſire to repair and reſtore the ſtrength of Gun-Powder that begins to alter, or that hath quite loſt its force, its defects may be amended three ſeveral wayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42528:174"/>
                     <p>The firſt is thus, make a Lye of two parts of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and one part of clarified Salt-Peter made into fine Powder, of good Vinegar made of good Wine half a part, of Oyl of Sulphur one eighth part, and as much Camphire diſſolved in Brandy; theſe put together, do make a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which muſt be ſtrained through a large Strainer, and then with it you may amend your powder that is decayed, by moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it with the ſame, very often, and drying it by the Sun in Wooden Veſſels, and then putting it up in a dry place, free from any humidity or air, and then it will not in a long time again be damnified.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way to repair Powder is thus, examine how much your Powder weighed when it was firſt put into the Cask or Barrel, then ſee how much it doth now weigh after 'tis damnified (it being firſt dryed if it chance to be wet) then ſee the difference between theſe two weights, and add ſo much Salt-Peter to your decayed powder, mix it well, and make it up into Corns again, and preſerve it as before.</p>
                     <p>The third way to reſtore the ſtrength of Gun-Powder, is ſuch as is moſt plain and commonly uſed amongſt the Powder-men; they put upon a Sale-cloath or ſmooth place or board, a portion of damnified Powder, to which they add an equal weight of that which is new made, and then with their hand or wooden Shovel they mingle it well together; then they dry it in the Sun, and put it up into a Barrel again, and keep it in a dry and proper place.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is another way may be allowed, but this is almoſt the ſame with making new Powder, and it is thus; Take what quantity of decayed Powder you pleaſe, put it into Earthen or Wooden Veſſels, pour upon the ſame three times ſo much hot water, ſtir it well about, and when it begins to be cold, or hath ſtood one hour or two, ſtrain the water away, and to the feces put more water, ſtirring it well about, then let it ſtand and ſettle as before, and ſtrain it from the feces, this do a third time, and you will have drawn out all the Salt-Peter; put theſe waters in a clean Kettle, and boyl it away until ſo much be conſumed, as that a drop dropped upon a Stone or Iron do congeal, then pour it into ſome wooden Veſſel that it may congeal into Salt-Peter; and that water as remains, you muſt boyl up again as before; and if need be, you muſt in the boyling skum what riſeth on the top of the water. Having by this Art obtained the Salt-Peter out of the decayed Gun-Powder, you may according to the proportions given in the Compoſition of Powder, mix it with its remaining Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Coal, or freſh Sulphur and Coal, which is better; and after 'tis well mixed, Corn it according to the given Rules; then let it be well dryed, and put up into dry Powder Barrels, and let it be conſerved in a dry place from Air or any Moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Some do mend their Powder in this nature, they moiſten it with Vinegar or fair water, beat it fine, and ſift it and dry it, and to every pound of Powder they put one Ounce of Mealed Salt-Peter; then moiſten and mix them well, ſo that neither may be diſcerned one from the other, but that they be perfectly incorporated, which you may know by cutting the Maſs with a Knife, or breaking it: When it is well compounded, let it be Corned in manner as we have before preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>If your Compoſition of Powder be made up with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ſo made up into great Balls, and well dryed in a Stove, or in the Sun, and put into glazed earthen Pots, and cloſe covered, you may keep it as long as you pleaſe, for age will not decay it.</p>
                     <p>There ought alwayes a care to be taken by Gunners or Fire-Maſters, or ſuch as have the charge of Gun-powder, to chuſe if they can ſuch places as are dry, and ſtand upon the beſt ground, free from dampneſs of the Air or any water poſſibly coming near. Every Gunner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to take care that his Barrel be turned upſide down, or any Carthredge ready filled; for if the Powder attract air, the Peter with the moiſture it hath attracted, will in time ſeperate from the other matters, and ſink to the bottom; ſo that the Powder in the upper part will looſe its ſtrength, which is prevented by turning and ſhaking them every fourteen dayes, and airing them at the Sun at convenient times. And as 'tis neceſſary a Gunner ſhould have Carthredges filled for preſent Service, thoſe ought alſo to be turned out and filled again every four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes more or leſs, as the Gunner in his judgment ſhall allow of.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the property and particular office of every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in the Compoſition of Gun-powder.</head>
                     <p>WE ought infallibly to believe that Gun-Powder was not found out caſually, or by fortune; but invented by a true knowledge, and by reaſonable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in Natural Philoſophy; conſidering that to this day no man hath oppoſed (notwithſtanding many perſons have made it their endeavour) or could find any other Materials like unto theſe, or of ſuch a nature, which being well united and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated together, they are able to produce a fire ſo vigorous, fearful, powerful, and above all, ſo inextinguiſhable that the whole Univerſal matter is conſumed in a moment; which is the more to be believed, ſince we make not much difficulty, particularly in this our Age wherein we live, to add many things to the invention of others, and that (as the Phyſitians ſay) all that had a beginning doth paſs from imperfection to perfection. We deſire therefore it may be permitted (ſince the Inventors have left us nothing in Writing) to propoſe here ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Speculative truths, drawn from Experiment, which have been made about the ſtrength, nature, effects, and Office of all the matters comprehended in the Compoſition of Gun-Powder, as well of the particulars, as all made up into one body. For I believe, that having inſinuated into a perfect knowledge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and the affections, as well ſpecificated as general, of all its Ingredients, no body more will fall into thoſe Errors which are too often committed in the Art of <hi>Pyrotechny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore know, that Gun-powder was not without reaſon compoſed of theſe three materials, to wit, Salt-Peter, Sulphur, and Coal, but to the end that one might remedy or ſupply the defaults of the others. And this is it which is eaſie to be comprehended in the effect of Sulphur; for this is naturally the very aliment of the fire, ſeeing it joyns with it ſo willingly and freely, and having once taken fire, is moſt difficult to put out, being no otherwiſe rightly than a flaming fire, or, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it better, a pure flame; and therefore hath an aptitude to enflame the Salt-Peter, by its activity, more than any other kind of fire. But as the Salt-Peter lighted doth go promptly into certain windy exhalations, it hath thereby ſuch a ſtrength in it, that it would by its ventoſity put out the flame which the Sulphur hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and by conſequence deny it ſelf of that which the Sulphur communicateth to it; hereby you may ſee, if one had made a ſimple compoſition of theſe two things only, that is, of Sulphur and Salt-Peter compounded well together, if fire were then applyed, they would in truth be ſuddenly enflamed, but they would ſoon after go out, that is, the fire will not continue to the Conflagration and Conſumption of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the reaſon whereof we have given a little before. It was therefore by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adjudged, that Coal well dryed and powdered, being adjoyned to theſe two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials in a certain proportion, was an excellent remedy for the ſupplying of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſeeing that Coal is of ſuch a property and of ſuch a nature, that if it be held to the fire, it will ſoon light and be reduced to a fire without any flame; And from hence it comes to paſs, that the more it is agitated by the Air, or by wind, the more the fire augments, and will not go out, but conſerve it ſelf until the matter that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth it is totally conſumed, a little aſhes only excepted. From hence it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that a Compoſition made of theſe three Ingredients, ſuch as is our Gunpowder, will conceive fire, and will be conſerved, enflamed and conſumed unto the laſt Atome. For it is moſt certain, that if we approach fire with it, the Sulphur which the fire extreamly loves is ſoon taken with it, and holdeth the ſame and introduceth it, not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42528:175"/> only into the Salt-Peter, but the coal alſo at the ſame moment, without producing any flame. Now this fire (as we have ſaid before) cannot be ſuffocated by wind, but on the contrary is enflamed the more, and takes new ſtrength by the agitation of the Air. And as this Sulphur is a great neighbour of the fire either with or without flame, ſo it cannot hinder it from taking fire; and 'tis the flame of the Brimſtone imbraces the Salt-Peter, and the Coal continues it. And by conſequence theſe three materials joyned together, and well incorporated, and then lighted, produceth a fire, until all its aliment and ſubſtance be univerſally conſumed and annihilated: Yet there muſt care be taken that none of theſe ſubſtances have any accidental defaults, either in humidity or diſproportion, either more or leſs. We will conclude then all that we have ſaid, that the true office of Sulphur in the Powder is to conceive the flame or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fire, and having received it, to communicate it to the other matters; and that the Coal hath a particular care to retain and conſume it, and to hinder the fire (after it is once introduced by the Sulphur) from ſuffocating or going out by any windy Exhalation and great violence cauſed by the Salt-Peter; and laſtly, that the moſt notable and particular office of the Salt-Peter is to produce and cauſe a moſt vehement and powerful ventoſity or windy Exhalation. And in this which I have ſaid, lieth all the truth of the ſtrength, power and expulſive motion and activity of the Gun-powder; and by conſequence Salt-Peter alone is the firſt and principal cauſe of all the admirable and aſtoniſhing Effects produced by Gunpowder; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the two other materials are alliated with the Salt-Peter for no other end than to make it break forth into fire and wind. For proof of this, if any one will make a Compoſition of Sulphur and Coal only, and with it charge a Piece of Ordnance, he will find that this will not move or thruſt out a Shot of Iron or any other metal; the reaſon of this weakneſs is eaſie to be underſtood by our foregoing diſcourſe, becauſe the violent expulſion depends abſolutely in the Salt-Peter, and in this only expulſive faculty, and not in any of the other matters. Yea I believe that one may prepare Gun-powder without Brimſtone or Coal, rather than without Salt-Peter; or that a man may without much difficulty prepare other matters, that the one may do the office of Sulphur in kindling the matter, and the other that of Coal in Conſerving it and keeping it without flame. But any other thing that hath ſuch hidden natural properties to cauſe ſuch a ventous Exhalation, ſo violent and capable to produce ſuch prodigious Effects, as Salt-Peter, may not be produced.</p>

The proof of theſe is known by multiplying the ſquare Root found in it ſelf (taking in the remains if any be) and it muſt produce that given number, otherwiſe it is falſe. Note how many pricks you have, and ſo many numbers muſt the quotient conſiſt of.</p>
                        <p>If the number given be not a true Square, then a fraction will remain, which fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you may find out the value thereof to a tenth, hundredth, or a thouſandth part; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doing thus ſet next to the right hand after the Sum propoſed, two, four, or ſix cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or more (for the more cyphers you put, the leſs is your Error) and every two cyphers will produce a fractional figure more than the Integers belonging to the proper quotient, which are tenths, hundredths, or thouſand parts of a Unite, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of cyphers added; that is, if you add two cyphers, then you find the tenths of a Unite <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Square Root being not of ſo much uſe in Gunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the Cube Root, we ſhall proceed no farther to Exemplifie the ſame, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be done already in the Treatiſe of Military Diſcipline.</p>

                        <p>Begin at your right hand, (as you did in Extracting the Square Root) and ſet pricks under every fourth figure, that is, leave two figures unprickt, or between the pricks, and ſo proceed to the left, until you have done as here you ſee, 7 5 6 7 8 7 3 2 (the number of pricks ſhew the number of figures that will be in the quotient.</p>
                        <p>Then ſee by the Table before in this Chapter the neareſt Cube to the numbers ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the firſt prick to the right hand, which is 75, I ſearch in the Table of Cubes and find the neareſt number to it in the Table of Cubes to be 64, and its Root 4, which muſt be ſet down in the quotient, and likewiſe its Cube 64 under the prick; and if that number doth not amount to ſo much as the number ſtanding over the prick, then ſubſtract it from the ſame, and ſet the Remainder overhead.</p>
                        <p>Then triple the quotient, and that triple you muſt ſet under the next number to the right hand, before that prick where you did laſt end.</p>
                        <p>Multiply that tripled number by the quotient, and ſet it down under the firſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that number let be your Diviſor.</p>

                        <p>Then (as in common Diviſion) muſt you look how many times the Diviſor in the figures is ſtanding over them, and place that in the quotient.</p>
                        <p>This done, Multiply your quotient by your Diviſor; and ſet it under your Diviſor, with a Line between.</p>
                        <p>Then multiply the laſt figure in the quotient by it ſelf, and then in the triple, and ſet that figure under the former, one figure more to the right hand.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Multiply the laſt figure cubically, and ſet that Sum alſo one figure to the Right hand; then add all theſe three multiplications together, and ſubſtract it out of figures ſtanding over the firſt and ſecond prick, and the Remainder ſet over them.</p>
                        <p>This done, again triple the quotient, and proceed exactly as before <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi> in his firſt Book, Section 4. hath ſhewed how to make a Line of Solids on his Sector; but this Rule ſhews us the proportion of the Diameters in Weight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Shot of one pound, two pounds, three pounds weight of Metal, or ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if the given Shot be one pound, divide the diameter of that Shot into 4 equal parts, and 5 ſuch parts will make a Diameter of a Shot of the ſaid Metal, as is propoſed, that ſhall weigh juſt twice as much. And divide the Diameter of a Shot that weighs juſt two pounds into ſeven equal parts, and eight ſuch parts will make the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds weight. And Divide the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds, into 10 equal parts, and 11 of ſuch parts will give a Shot of 4 pounds weight. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Shot of 4 pounds weight into 13 parts, and 14 ſuch parts will make a Shot of 5 pounds in weight. And divide the Diameter of a Shot of 5 pounds weight, into 16 equal parts, and 17 ſuch parts will make a Diameter of a ſhot that will weigh 6 pounds. And ſo dividing the Diameter of a ſhot 6 pounds weight into 19 equal parts, and 20 ſuch parts will make a Diameter of a ſhot that will weigh 7 pounds. Thus dividing each next Diameter into three equal parts more than the next leſs Diameter was divided into, and with one part added to the Diameter of a ſhot it will weigh juſt one pound more, and ſo may proceed infinitely.</p>

                        <p>Then take the diſtance <hi>d</hi> 2, in your Compaſſes, and ſet it off from <hi>e</hi> to 3, ſo will that diſtance be the Diameter of a ſhot of three pounds weight; and ſo you may proceed in the ſame manner at your pleaſure; as you may ſee by the projection.</p>

                     <p>But if you would know whether the bore lie more upwards or downwards, then bend a Wire at the very end, ſo that it being put in at the very touch hole, may ketch at the metal when it is drawn out, then put the Wire down the touch hole till it touch

                     <p>FOr the better expedition of this work we have in the former Table ſhewed the length and breadth of each Ladle, always remembring that you cut each Ladle ſomewhat longer, that is, allowing ſo much more as muſt be faſtned to the ſtaff, or ſo much as the ſtaff goes within the Plate.</p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42528:188"/>
                     <p>The Buttons or heads of the Ladles muſt be near the height of the ſhot.</p>
                     <p>For Spunges, the bottoms and heads muſt be of ſoft wood, as Birch and Willow, and to be one Diameter and three quarters in length, and three quarters or very little leſs of the height covered with Sheeps skin, and nayled with Copper nayles, ſo that together they may fill the hollow of the Piece; Let the bottoms and heads of the Rammers be made of good hard wood, and the height, one Diameter of the Shot, and the length one third of the Diameter of the Shot.</p>
                     <p>To make Ladles for Chamber bor'd Pieces, open your Compaſſes to the juſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the Chamber within one eighth part of an Inch, Divide that meaſure in two equal parts, then ſet the meaſure to one of them, and by that diſtance upon a flat or paper draw a Circle, the Diameter of that Circle is one fourth part ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Diameter of the Chamber; Take three fifths of that Circle for the breadth of the Plate of the Ladle. But for Cannon, the length ought to be twice and two third parts, to hold at twice the juſt Diameter of the Powder. As for Example,</p>
                     <p>The Diameter of a Circle drawn for a Cannon whoſe Chamber bore is 7 Inches, containeth ſix and three quarters, the circumference whereof is 21 Inches 6/7, and three fourth parts thereof is 12 ¾, and ſo much ought the Ladle to be in breadth, and in length 18 ⅔ parts. By this Rule you may make a Ladle for any Taper'd Piece.</p>
                     <p>Take notice for a general obſervation, that a Ladle 9 balls in length, and two balls in breadth, will near contain the juſt weight in Powder, that the Iron Shot for any piece weigheth.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for Cartredges, they are generally made of paper Royal or Canvas. Take the height of the bore of your piece without the vent of the Shot, and cut the cloath or paper of 3 ſuch heights, for the Cannon in length 3 Diameters, for the Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin 4 Diameters, for the Saker and Faulcon <hi>&amp;c.</hi> half of the height of their proper bores, and leaving in the midſt at the top or bottome one other ſuch height, to make a bottom for the Cartredge, cutting each ſide ſomthing larger for Sewing, glewing, or paſting them together; you muſt have a great care to augment the goodneſs of your powder, and likewiſe the heating of your Piece, and ſo augment or diminiſh the quantity of Powder.</p>
                     <p>Let your Former be made to your Ordnance to the height of your Shot, and a convenient length longer than the Cartredge ought to be, and tallow it over firſt that the paper may ſlip off, and then put your paper on your Former. If you make your Cartredge of Canvas, half a Diameter more is allowed for ſeams, but if you make it of paper, half or three quarters of an Inch over-plus for paſting will ſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lapt once about the Former; having the bottom fitted upon the end of the Former, which muſt be hard and cloſe paſted by the lower ſide of the Cartredge, then let the lower end of the Cartredge be paſted down hard round about the bottom, and let them be well dryed before you fill them, and mark them how high they muſt be filled.</p>
                     <p>And if you have no Scales nor weights by you for Cannons, put two Diameters and a half for the height the powder muſt come, for Culverin 3 Diameters, for Saker 3 and a half Diameters, for leſſer Pieces four Diameters of the Cylinder.</p>
                     <p>For Carriages of Pieces of Ordnance for Land ſervice the Rules are given thus, one and a half the length of the Cylender is the length of the Carriage, and in depth four Diameters of the bore of the Piece at the fore end, in the middle three and a half, and at the end next the ground two and a half, let the thickneſs be the Diameter of the Shot, the wheels ſhould be one half of the length of the Piece in height, but for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Minion you muſt exceed the former proportion by one twelfth part, the Faulcon and Faulconet by one ſixth part.</p>
                     <p>The Naves, the Cheeks called Limbres, and wheels, are uſually made of Elm, but the Tranſoms, Axeltreees, Fore-Carriage and Croſs beams, are made of Oaken Timber.</p>
                     <p>For drawing of Guns by men in caſe horſes be wanting, there is uſually allowed to every ſixty, eighty, or a hundred weight of metal to one man, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ground whereon they are to be drawn.</p>

                     <p>As for Sea Carriages, they are ſo well known to every Carriage-maker that they need not to be ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>As for fitting Shot to each Piece, it is the opinion of moſt Gunners, that every Piece of Ordnance ought to have its Shot within one quarter of an Inch of the Diameter of the bore; others do ſay, that the one and twentieth part of the Diameter of the Piece's Cylender is more proper and correſpondent for all ſorts of Pieces whatſoever; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may make choice of that which by experience he finds beſt.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> How a Gunner ought to charge a Piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</head>
                     <p>HAving ſhewed the compleat making of Pieces of Ordnance, and the preparing of powder and Shot, with the due allowance of powder fit for every Gun, with all the Inſtruments and Materials neceſſarily belonging to a Piece, as to its Rigging and Loading; It remains now, that we go <hi>Artiſt like</hi> to work to charge a Piece, and order all things for the beſt conveniency, and that the leſs danger may follow when you come to Action or Service; and for that purpoſe having planted your Piece upon the plat-form, have in readineſs powder, Bullets, Linſtocks, Scowrers, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the reſt of your things. Stick up your Linſtock to Leeward of you; then to work with your Piece. Firſt, cleer your Piece within with the Scowrer, and ſee that the touch hole be clear, and not ſtopped, and ſo clear, that no dirt or filth be in the ſame; Then let him that is by to aſſiſt, (for a Piece cannot be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by leſs than two) bring the Budg-barrel with the powder juſt before the mouth of your Piece, put then your Ladle into the ſame and fill it, and if it be over-full, give it a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>og, that the overplus may fall down again into the barrel; after this, put it gently in at the mouth of the Piece, even until the end of the Ladle be thruſt up to the Britch end of the Piece; then muſt you turn the Ladle gently and ſoftly, and let it lie within the Chamber of the piece, drawing out your Ladle almoſt to the Muzzle of the Piece, put it back again to take up the looſe corns, which were ſpilt by the way, and to bring them up to the Charge of powder; this done, the Gunner muſt draw out this Ladle, and take out of the Budg-barrel a ſecond Ladle full, (by our former Rules given he muſt know the quantity of powder that his Piece will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) and ſo putting it in the Piece up to the former Ladle-full, then you may draw it out, and do as you did before, that no looſe corns may lie in the bottom of the Piece; and in drawing out his Ladle, he muſt have a care that he let not fall any powder upon the ground; for it is a thing uncomly in a Gunner, to trample powder under feet. Then take a wiſp of Straw, Hay, or any other thing, and put it hard in at the mouth of the Piece, then turn your Ladle end for end to come to the Rammer, thruſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Piece after the wiſp, and drive it up with it, and it will carry all the looſe corns which poſſibly may be ſcattered in the Mold of the Piece; having driven the wad up to the powder, give it two or three gentle ſhoves to make it lie cloſe only, but drive it not too hard leaſt you break your powder too much, which would hinder its force; The wiſp or wad being cloſe to the powder, draw out the Rammer and put in the Bullet, which rowle gently in the Piece up to the wad that was before put in to keep up the powder, the Shot being in, put in a ſecond wad after the Bullet, and thruſt it alſo home to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42528:189"/> the Bullet. Always remembring whilſt the powder is putting in and wadding up, one be ready at the touch hole and keep it ſtopt with his thumb, that no powder fly out at the touch hole, but that it be likewiſe filled with powder, which may be ſupplyed out of his powder-horn.</p>
                     <p>The Gunner that Loads a Piece is to be very careful, and indeavour always not to ſtand before the muzzle of his Piece whilſt he is loading the Piece, but on one ſide of the ſame, leaſt a danger or miſchief might happen to him. And thus the Piece ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its due Charge of Powder and Bullet, he muſt cover the touch-hole with an Apron made of Lead, or for want of that, with dryed Sheep-skin; then let him level his piece and ſet away the Budg-barrel of powder with the reſt of his things, in ſome hollow place under the ground covered over ſafe; he muſt then attend the Gentleman of the Ordnance, or other chief Commander, their Order or Command, before he give fire.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Charges of Pieces, I have given full inſtructions neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, with the weight of powder and Shot for any piece. But to ſay ſomething here touching the quantity of powder, proper for a Load; we do find ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference amongſt Authors; Some whereof do maintain, that there ought to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every Piece for its Charge ſo much powder as half the weight of the Bullet; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of the opinion, that the more powder is put into a Piece, the ſwifter and farther the Bullet will flye, urging many reaſons to prove it. But experience, the Miſtreſs of this Art inſtructeth us better, for if a Piece be loaden with two thirds of the weight of her Shot in powder, it ſends the Bullet or Shot going more ſwiftly, and will carry it farther, which hath been very many and often times tryed, ſo that at this time, 'tis without contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Again, others do maintain, that if one ſhould forcibly Ramme the Bullet, then the powder might take fire before it caſt forth the Bullet, and then would cauſe the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to flye farther than otherwiſe it would do; but you muſt conſider in ſo doing, you either endanger the breaking of the piece, or elſe the making it crooked and unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; becauſe your ordinary Pieces will not bear ſo great a Charge of powder. This hath been tryed by the Sea ſide before his Excellency <hi>Prince Maurice,</hi> of famous memory, where firſt one and the ſame Piece was Loaden with ten pound of fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſee how far She would carry the Bullet; the place being marked where the Bullet reſted. The Piece was loaden again with nine pounds of powder which ſhot as far as when the Piece was Loaden with ten pounds of powder. But laſt of all, this piece of Ordnance being Loaden or Charged with 7 pounds of the ſame powder, it carried her Bullet further than the two former Shots; whence one may obſerve that a piece of Ordnance may be over-Charged, and therefore a good Gunner ought to have a ſingular care to give unto his Piece her due meaſure and Charge.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of the Office and Duty of a Gunner, with all his Properties, Endowments and qualifications.</head>
                     <p>HE that intends to be a Maſter Gunner, and would not abuſe himſelf nor others of the ſame profeſſion, muſt be qualified according to our Inſtructions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ought to be well skilled in Arithmetick, and to underſtand the Extraction of the Square and Cube Roots, and to have knowledge in Geometry, according to our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42528:189"/> Inſtructions in the ſecond part, whereby he may be able to take heights, depths, breadths and lengths, and to draw the plot of any piece of ground, to make Mines and Countermines, Rampars, Baskets of earth, and ſuch like things uſed in time of war, as well offenſive as defenſive.</p>
                     <p>He ought moſt chiefly upon Land-Service to be well skilled in the making Plat-formers, with Defences, Troniers, Gabbions, Loops, Parapets of Earth, and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots of 23 or 24 foot high; two foot high of Earth, bed upon bed, unto eleven foot high, and after three foot <hi>Terra plene,</hi> to raiſe the Tronniers and Loops, ſo that for the Cannon it be three foot wide in the Barbe, and within twelve foot wide, without the lower part thereof to deſcend Scarp-wiſe, the better to diſcover the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies avenues and offend them more freely, for avoiding the blaſt and Smoak and ruine it would elſe make: for Culverin two foot and a half within, and nine foot without will ſerve; and for leſs Pieces the leſs meaſure.</p>
                     <p>If the Battery be to be made with Gabbions, they being filled with Earth without Stones, moiſtned and Rammed 7 foot in Diameter, three Ranks between two Pieces, if the place will permit, or two at leaſt; and three Rows alſo one before the other, ſetting one between two, ſo that if one Rank will have three, the ſecond will have two, and the third one; but it will be hard to make a ſafe Battery with Gabbions, Cannon or Culverin proof.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Plat-forms. Let the platform for a Cannon have thirty foot for reverſe, and 27 foot for a Demy-Cannon, and he ought to ſee that his plat-forms be even, or riſing one foot for 20 foot backward the better to ſtay the Reverſe, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the bringing the piece when Loaden to the Loop. The platform ought to be made clean, that no ſtones or other things lye in the way for the wheels to run upon, whereby may be hindered the true intent of his Shot.</p>
                     <p>He muſt before any ſervice is, examine his Piece of its goodneſs or defect; according to our former Inſtructions given in this behalf, he muſt alſo be furniſhed with all neceſſary things for his Artillery, the particulars thereof we have mentioned in the 29 <hi>Chap.</hi> but becauſe it takes not up much paper we will repeat them here again, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wheels, Trucks, Axeltrees, Ladles, Rammers, Spunges, Worms, Tampions, height-board, Auger-bit, fitneſs and roundneſs of the Shot, Chane-Shot, Croſs-bar Shot <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Canvas or ſtrong paper for Cartredges, Calabers, Compaſſes, Sight Rule, Gunners Scale, Quadrant, Scales, Weights, priming-Irons, and Aprons to cover the Touch hole.</p>
                     <p>Before he come upon Service, he ought to examine and prove the goodneſs of his Powder and Match, and examine it according to the Rules given where we treat of the Examination of the goodneſs of Powder.</p>
                     <p>A Gunner ought to be moſt careful to ſee that the Powder be placed ſafely from danger of his own, as alſo the Enemies Ordnance, and to be furniſhed with artificial Torches, Dark Lanthorns, with all ſorts of Fire-works, of which you ſhall have a particular account in the Treatiſe of Fire-works at the end of this Book.</p>
                     <p>He muſt have by him his Gyn and Winch, Hand-Spikes, Crowes, to mount and diſmount Guns at pleaſure as occaſion may ſerve, alſo Coynes, Budge-Barrels, Powder Baskets to carry Shot to your Piece, to keep his Linſtocks well armed with good Match.</p>
                     <p>He muſt alwayes have by him a Ruler, Scale, Compaſſes, to meaſure the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters or Bore of every Piece, and likewiſe the length of the Cylinder within, the better to fit her with due Shot and Proportion of Powder.</p>
                     <p>He muſt learn by ſuch Inſtructions as we have already given, the Names, Length, Weight, and Fortification of every Piece about the Chamber, and to tell readily how much Powder is a due Charge for every Piece, and what Shot is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. How many Perſons muſt attend in time of Service, how many Horſes or Oxen will draw a Piece of Ordnance, and in caſe they be wanting, how many men will ſerve. How many pound weight of Shot one man may drive before him in a Wheel-barrow from place to place.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42528:190"/>
                     <p>A Gunner ought chiefly to Charge and Diſcharge a Piece of Ordnance Artiſt like; and when he opens, or orders to be opened the head of a Powder Barrel, let no Iron Tool be uſed thereunto for fear of taking or ſtriking fire; for that purpoſe therefore it is uſual to have wooden Mallets, which will prevent ſuch dangers.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner before he beginneth to make a Shot, ought to conſider that a wad of Hay, or of untwiſted Ropes, will make the Shot ſhoot wide of the Mark.</p>
                     <p>He ought to conſider whether the Trunions be placed in their due place in the Carriage, whether the Carriage have its due length, whether one wheel be not higher than the other, or whether one wheel doth not reverſe quicker or ſooner than the other, for theſe will cauſe the Piece to erre, and to ſhoot wide of the Mark.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner ought to conſider, that if his Piece lye point blank or under Metal, then he ought to put in a ſufficient wad after the Shot, to keep it cloſe to the Powder; for if it ſhould not be cloſe, great danger might follow; for if the Shot ſhould lodge any diſtance from the Powder, then in the firing of that Piece it would break off in that very vacant place between the Shot and the Powder, and ſo do dammage to himſelf for ſtanders by. If your Piece be mounted, you then uſe no wad at all after the Shot.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner ought to have ſtanding by him ſome Tubs of water to wet his Spunges in, whereby to cool his Piece in time of Service, as alſo to be ready upon occaſion to put out any Fire that might happen in time of Service.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner ought to try whether his Piece is truely bored or not; if it be not, he is to take it into conſideration, and to order his proportion of Charge, according to the thinneſt part of the Metal, to prevent all danger.</p>
                     <p>A Gunner ought to take his Obſervation of the Mark or place he intends to direct his Shot to, juſt over the middle of the bore within the Piece, for by this means he may be able, by his Skill, to make a true Shot in a bad Piece.</p>
                     <p>A Gunner, that he may the better direct his Shot to the place deſired, ought to conſider the difference of the Metal of the Piece at Britch and Muzzle, and thereby truely how to diſpart a Piece, be in either true bored or not. Of diſparting a Piece, I ſhall ſhew how it may be done ſeveral wayes in the following or ſecond part of this Gunnery; where we come to the practical part of the Art in handling a Piece of Ordnance upon all occaſions.</p>

                     <p>COnvey the left ſide of the Quadrant Geometrically towards the Sun, the Thread and Plummet having their free courſe, moving it up or down until both your ſights have received the Sun-beams; then if your Thread be found in the twelfth part, all things that are upright or truly perpendicularly elevated, are equal in height with their ſhadows.</p>
                     <p>If the Thread with the plummet be obſerved to cut any of thoſe parts next the ſights, called right ſhadow, between <hi>m</hi> and <hi>h,</hi> then every upright thing is more than the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, by ſuch a proportion as 12 exceeds the parts where the Thread was found.</p>
                     <p>If the Thread fall upon the firſt diviſion, then 12 times the ſhadow is the height. If it fall upon the ſecond Diviſion, 6 times the ſhadow is the height. If it fall upon the third Diviſion, 4 times the ſhadow is the height. If it fall on the fourth Diviſion, 3 times the ſhadow is the height. In the fifth Diviſion twice and two fifths of the ſhadow is the height. In the ſixth twice, in the ſeventh once, and five ſevenths in the eighth Diviſion, one and a half in the ninth, one and a third in the tenth, one and a fifth part in the eleventh, once and the eleventh part of the ſhadow is the height on the twelfth part, then the length of the ſhadow is the height, as we ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>Or in few words it may be done thus, Multiply the length of the ſhadow by 12, the product divided by the parts in which you found the Thread, your quotient ſheweth the height.</p>
                     <p>But if the part cut be on the contrary ſhadow, that is, if the Thread fall between <hi>g</hi> and <hi>m,</hi> augment then the length of the ſhadow by the parts declared by the plummet, and the increaſe divide by 12, and the product is the Altitude.</p>

                     <p>AMongſt many practices I find this the onlieſt way to obtain our deſire without the help of an Inſtrument, yet in this is neceſſarily required to have ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at liberty on one ſide. Then begin thus; at the beginning of your Length ſet up a ſtaff or mark that may be ſeen afar off, then go from it Orthogonal or Square-wiſe on which ſide you will 200 foot; the more ground the better; Put up there a ſtaff alſo: now convey your ſelf to the firſt ſtaff or mark, going back from it 300 foot, more or leſs, at your pleaſure, ſet up there a third ſtaff ſo, that the firſt mark or ſtaff and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree all in a ſtreight Line from your ſight to the fartheſt part of your length by the judgment of your eye; now go ſide-wiſe from thence as far in a right Angle, until the ſecond mark offer it ſelf aright between the extream part of your length and ſight, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42528:194"/> there put the fourth ſtaff. All this performed, ſeek out the diſtance between the firſt ſtaff and the Second, and that name your firſt diſtance; then the diſtance between the firſt and third, name your ſecond diſtance; Again, the diſtance between the third and fourth ſtaff is the third diſtance. Deduct your firſt diſtance from the third, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the Diviſor; then multiply your third diſtance by your ſecond, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct divide by your Diviſor, the quotient ſheweth the true length from the third ſtaff to the fortreſs or mark deſired: for plainneſs behold the figure.</p>

                     <p>Here this Letter A repreſents the Caſtle, being the diſtance to be meaſured; B is your firſt ſtaff; C the ſecond ſtaff, differing from B the firſt Orthogonal 100 foot; D the third ſtaff, being diſtant back from the firſt in a Right line with the mark A 133 foot; E is the fourth ſtaff, running ſidewiſe Orthogonally, or in a Square, from the third, until the fartheſt part of your length A, is perceived in a right Line with the ſecond ſtaff at C; and this diſtance D E let be 120 foot. Now by Subſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction take 100 from 120, there remaineth for a Diviſor 20; then multiply 133 by 120, ſo riſeth 15960, which divided by 20, and there cometh 798 foot, the true diſtance between D and A, from which if you abate A B 133, there remaineth B A your propounded diſtance.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as this concluſion is to be done without Inſtrument, and here Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogonal motions ſidewiſe is required, it ſhall be requiſite alſo to declare how an Orthogonal or Right angle is upon a ſudden to be made; ye ſhall therefore (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Invention mentioned among the Definitions at the beginning of this Book) take 3 Staves, Cords, or ſuch like, making the one 4 ſuch parts, as the other is 3, and the third 5; This done, conjoyn their ends together, and the angle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of the longeſt ſtaff is a right, which firſt placed at B, and after at D, directing one of his comprehending ſides to A, the other ſhall guide you to C and E; or if you deſire with more expedition to diſpatch, and not to tarry the proportioning of Cords, or ſuch like, to this Pythogarick Rule, take any 3 Staves, Sticks, or Threads, and conjoyn them, making a Triangle, it matters not of what form or faſhion they be, then placing one angle thereof at B, turning one ſide to A, direct your ſelf ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the other, alwayes remembring to place the ſame angle at D, and departing ſidewiſe again in like manner, in all the reſt do as before is declared.

                     <p>YOu muſt firſt (as we have declared in the laſt Chapter) prepare a Triangle, with joyning any three Staves, or ſuch like, together, which you muſt (at your ſtanding) place in ſuch ſort, that one of the ſides containing the Angles, may lye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly toward the Mark: Then ſetting up a Staff, Pike, or other Mark there, depart ſidewiſe, as the other ſide of your Angle ſhall direct you, ſo far as you liſt, the more ground the better, and there ſet up your ſecond Staff or Mark; then go directly back from your firſt Staff (alwayes keeping it exactly between your ſight and the Mark) as many ſcore again, or Pike lengths, as you liſt, ſetting up a third ſtaff; this done, you ſhall place the ſame Angle you uſed at your firſt Staff now again at your third ſtaff, in all points as it was before; the one ſide of the Angle lying directly toward the firſt Staff, the other ſide will ſhew you whither you ſhall go to place your fourth Staff; for paſſing ſtill in a right line with that ſide of your Angle, you ſhall at the laſt find the ſecond juſtly ſcituated between you and the fartheſt Mark, and there ſet up the fourth Staff; then remove your Angle again to the ſecond Staff, and placing there as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the one ſide even with the firſt Staff, paſs on in a right line with the other, until you come directly between your neareſt Mark and the fourth Staff, and there pitch up the fifth.</p>

                     <p>But if you would find C B, or the Hypothenuſal line being the diſtance between the ſecond Station and the mark; then by the former Table of Squares, or with your Pen, find the Square of A C, and the Square A B the diſtance already found from the firſt Station, theſe two Squares added together, the Square Root of that Sum is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance C B, <hi>viz.</hi> 253 paces; or if the Sum of the Square of A B and A C be ſought for in the Table of Squares, you will find againſt it 253 paces, the length of C B, which was to be found; for the Square of A B more, A C is alwayes equal to the Square of C B, and the Square of C B leſs, the Square A C is equal to the Square of A B.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> How to make a true Diſpart of any true bored Piece of Ordnance.</head>
                     <p>KNow firſt, that to diſpart a Piece of Ordnance, is no otherwiſe than to bring the Diameter at Muzzle to be equal to the Diameter at the Baſe Ring; in true founded Ordnance, half of the Diameter of the Cylender is the diſpart; but more generally it may be done thus, Gird the Piece round about the Britch with a thred, after do the like by the Muzzle Ring, lay theſe two ſtrings ſtreight upon a Table at length, and make two marks for the length of each ſtring; divide the diſtance between each of theſe two marks into 22 equal parts with your Compaſſes, and 7 of them are their Diameters; then meaſure how much each Diameter is in length, and ſubſtract one Diameter from the other, then take the juſt half of the difference, and that is the true diſpart of your Piece in inches, and part of an inch.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Diameters are better and more artificially taken with a pair of Crallipars, as we have ſhewed before in taking the Diameter of a Shot, and then meaſured upon your Scale of inches and parts, will give you the true Diameters of the Piece both at Britch and Muzzle, with which work as above.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may find the true diſpart of a Piece thus; Put a ſmall Wyer or priming Iron in at the Touch-hole of the Piece to the bottom of the Concave; then mind what part of that Iron is even with the Baſe Ring, and make a mark there; then take it out and apply it to the Muzzle, and place it upon the lower edge of the Concave of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42528:201"/> the Piece as upright as you can, and mind what part of the Iron or Wyer is even with the upper part of the Muzzle Ring, and there make a mark; for the difference between theſe two marks, is the true diſpart of the Piece: or after you have placed your Iron upon the Muzzle as before, cauſe a diſpart to be raiſed ſo high as that mark which was made upon the Iron when 'twas put down the Touch-hole.</p>
                     <p>If from the top of the diſpart a fine thread or line be carried to the Muzzle Ring, you will ſee how high you may make a diſpart at the Trunions.</p>
                     <p>Or thus a diſpart may be made at the Trunions; lay a peece of ſoft Wax upon the Trunions, and let one raiſe it high, or depreſs it, until that the Metal at the top of the Baſe Ring, the Wax between the Trunions, and the diſpart of the Muzzle, be all three of one height preciſely; but the former way with a thread is more exact.</p>
                     <p>A Piece of Ordnance may be diſparted thus; take two ſticks (each of them muſt be longer than the Piece) and alſo make a Plummet of Lead to hang in a ſmall thread made faſt to one end of the ſtick, which lay croſs the top of the Baſe Ring, to and fro, until the Plummet deſcending from the end thereof, may juſt touch the ſide of the Metal of the ſaid Ring; then keeping faſt the ſtick in that place, hang your Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met down by the other ſide of the ſtick, until it on the otherſide juſt touch the Metal of the Baſe Ring; when you have done, cut off the ſtick juſt in that place by which the Plummet deſcended, perpendicularly, and this length is the juſt Diameter of the Baſe Ring; after this manner you muſt proceed to take the Diameter at the Muzzle. Then laſtly, ſet theſe two ſticks together even at one end, and mark their difference in length or height; for juſt half of that difference is the diſpart of that Piece.</p>
                     <p>I would adviſe all Sea Gunners upon ſome occaſions to uſe Diſparts between the Trunions of their Pieces, made of a juſt height, on purpoſe to ſerve that place, by the method we have even now preſcribed, and let them be tyed about the Piece with a twine, becauſe elſe at every Shot they will be to ſeek, when upon a ſuddain they ſhould uſe them, and they will much avail and ſtand them in great ſtead. I could expreſs other wayes, only I think theſe ſufficient.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> How to give Level with a Piece of Ordnance to make a Shot at any Mark aſſigned.</head>
                     <p>SEt your diſpart on the Muzzle Ring, juſt over the Center of the mouth of the Piece, which you may beſt do by putting a ſtick croſs the bore, and dividing it into two equal parts; then with a Plumb line hanging over the mouth of the Piece, being guided by the divided ſtick, you ſhall have good aim where to ſet your Diſpart; this being done, go to the Baſe Ring, if the Piece be true bored, then find which is the higheſt part, and middle of that Ring; but if the Piece be not true bored, then find which part of the Baſe Ring is juſt over the Cylender, and take that for your true line: when you have found out the diſpart, and placed it, and alſo found what point in the Baſe Ring is to anſwer to it, then make ſome very ſmall mark on the Baſe Ring in that place, hold your head about two foot from the Baſe Ring, and there you may beſt obſerve, as the Piece is traverſing, when you are in a direct line with the mark; this done, give one of your men order to raiſe and fall the Piece with his Hand-ſpike as you ſhall appoint him, until you can, holding your head two foot from the Britch of the Piece, with your eye perceive the mark at the Baſe Ring, and the top of the diſpart in a direct line with the mark you muſt ſhoot at; at that inſtant ſtop the motion of the Piece with a Coyn, that it may remain as you have directed it; then Prime your Piece, and give fire.</p>

                     <p>Before you place your Diſpart, you are to take notice whether the ground be Level whereon the Wheels of the Gun ſtand, or if they be not one higher than the other, and if the Trunions ſtand juſt over the Axeltree of the Wheels or no; whether one Trunion lye higher on the Carriage than the other: whether the Gun be truely placed in the Carriage or not; that is, that it be not nearer one ſide than the other: whether the Carriage be truly made according to the direction we have already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the firſt part; whether the Axeltree be placed juſt croſs the Carriage or not.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> How, if a Shot do carry to the right or to the left, under or over the mark, by reaſon of ſome known fault, to amend it in making the next Shot.</head>
                     <p>AFter you have made one Shot, and find the Piece carry juſt over the mark, then do all that has been taught again, and when your Piece lyes directly againſt the mark, obſerve how much the laſt ſtroak of the Shot is above the mark, ſo much longer make your diſpart, that the top of it may be juſt ſeen from the Britch of the Piece, in a direct line with the ſtroke of the Shot; when it is of this length, then level your Piece with this new diſpart to the aſſigned mark, Give fire, and without doubt it will ſtrike the ſame.</p>
                     <p>If the firſt Shot ſtrike under the mark, then bring the Piece in all points as before to paſs, mark how much of the diſpart is over the ſtroke of the Shot, and cut it juſt ſo ſhort, as being at the Britch you may diſcern the top of it, with the mark on the Baſe Ring and ſtroke of the Shot in a juſt right line, and when you perceive it is of ſuch a length, level the Piece to the aſſigned mark, as at the firſt, then Prime and Give fire.</p>
                     <p>If the firſt Shot ſtrike on the right hand of the mark, to mend it you muſt level the Piece as formerly; you ſtanding behind the Britch of the Piece, obſerve the ſtroke of the Shot over the diſpart, and that part of the Baſe Ring as you at that inſtant look over in a right line towards the diſpart, and the ſtroke of the Shot, ſet up in that place a Pin with a little ſoft Wax on the Baſe Ring; ſo this Pin will be in a right line with the diſpart and ſtroke of the Shot: This being done, level your Piece to the mark aſſigned by this Pin and the diſpart, and without queſtion you will make a fair Shot; for when you level by the Metal of the Baſe Ring where the Pin is placed, and the mark of the Piece ſtanding at that direction, look over the top of the diſpart from the notch in the Baſe Ring, and you ſhall find it to lye juſt ſo much to the left, as the former Shot ſtruck to the right, from the aſſigned mark, which ſhould in all likelyhood now ſtrike the mark.</p>
                     <p>But if a Shot be both too wide and too low, then you muſt uſe both the directions above taught, to make the next Shot: firſt regulate the diſpart by cutting it ſhorter, according as the Shots mark is lower than the aſſigned mark; when this is done, then proceed to my directions to mend ſhooting wide, and theſe things performed with care and diligence, cannot chooſe but mend a bad Shot.</p>

                     <p>FOr the effecting of this matter, we muſt have a Quadrant with a Thread and Plummet (which is deſcribed in the firſt Chapter of this ſecond Section) to one ſide of this Quadrant; ſo that one end of the Ruler may go into the Cavity of the Piece, and let a Piece of Lead be faſtned to the end of the Rule, to make it lye cloſe to the bottom of the Metal within, the Quadrant hanging without, and the Plumb-line ſwaying or hanging down from the Center of the Quadrant, perpendicular to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line; for the Quadrant being thus placed, you may mount a Piece to what degree you ſhall find fit to ſhoot by.</p>
                     <p>Now every one that will learn to ſhoot at Random, muſt draw his Piece on a level ground, where firſt ſhooting level, he muſt obſerve that diſtance in feet or paces, then mount his Piece to one degree, and mark where that ſhall graze; thus finding the diſtance of every degree from the level to the tenth degree, by theſe diſtances make a Table, to which annex the degrees againſt the diſtance; by which Table you may (uſing the Art of Proportions) find how far another Piece will convey her Shot from degree to degree, and in Loading your Piece for this work you muſt have your Powder exactly weighed, and likewiſe the Wad, and let the Piece cool of it ſelf, and this you muſt do every time; and if the Piece be mounted, there needs no Wad after the Shot; alſo you muſt have a ſpecial care of the ſtrength of the Powder, and let the Powder equally, and with the ſame force and ſtrength be preſſed home, as near as poſſible you may.</p>

But firſt I ſhall ſet down Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Experiment, not as he is Mathematician, as he writes himſelf (which Title none of our Learned Mathematicians of <hi>England</hi> do aſſume) but as he was a Practical Gunner, and made theſe ſeveral experiments upon four ſeveral degrees of Mounture, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 deg. 5 deg. 7 deg. 10 deg. from thence was found theſe Randoms.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42528:203"/>
                     <p>At 1 degree, the Shot did light from the Piece or place of ſtanding 225 paces.</p>
                     <p>At 5 degrees, the Random was 416 paces.</p>
                     <p>At 7 degrees, the Random was 505 paces.</p>
                     <p>At 10 degrees the Random was 630 paces.</p>
                     <p>And by theſe Experiments a Table may be framed according to this Rule. As the known degree of Mounture, is to the number of paces the Piece carries; ſo is the number of degrees propoſed, to the diſtance required.</p>

                     <p>Now that we may be underſtood-well, we muſt know that there are two ſorts of Ranges or Motions of a Shot, of which you may ſee more in Chap. 20. the one is called the Right Range, and the other is termed the Curved or Crooked Range, and theſe two there termed a Compound Range, is called the Dead Range; that is to ſay, the whole diſtance from your Platform from whence the Shot was made, to the place where the Bullet firſt grazes; yet the perpendicular deſcending of the Bullet is alſo called the Natural motion, as you may ſee by the figure hereafter placed. Captain <hi>Hexham</hi> in his Book of Gunnery, ſhews how by finding out the Random of a Cannon for the firſt degree of Mounture to find the Random for every degree to 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is the utmoſt Random, after this manner; Firſt, find out how many paces the Cannon will ſhoot, being laid level by the Metal (which he accounts for one degree of Mounture) divide this diſtance by 50, then multiply the Quotient by 11, and that will bring out the number of the greateſt digreſſion or difference between Range and Range, which being divided by 44, the Quotient will ſhew the number of paces which the Bullet will looſe in the other Ranges from degree to degree. <hi>Example.</hi> A Battering Cannon being laid by the Metal, will ſhoot his Bullet (as he ſaith) 1000 ordinary paces, two foot and a half to each pace; which being divided by 50, the Quotient will be 20, which multiplyed by 11, is 220 paces, which is the number of the next digreſſion made in the ſecond degree: which 220 divide by 44, the number of the remaining degrees yields 5, which is the number of paces to be diminiſhed in each degree; and by this Rule this Table is framed.</p>

                     <p>The uſe of this Table is thus; having reſolved upon what point of Mounture, look in this Table for the name of the Piece, and right under that point againſt the name of the Piece, that is in the common Angle, you ſhall find the number of paces of her Random ſought.</p>

                     <p>THe right Range of every Piece being diſcharged in a level, or parallel to the Horizon, is allowed by ſome not to exceed 185 paces, that is 5 foot to a pace, yet ſome reckon much more, but then they account ordinary ſteps or paces of two foot and a half; and Batteries made with ſuch Pieces are uſally made at 100 or 120 ſuch paces, at which diſtance they do the beſt execution.</p>
                     <p>The utmoſt Random likewiſe of any Piece that is from the Platform to the firſt graze of the Bullet, I find by ſome to be about ten times the diſtance of the right Range; and accordingly I have ſo ſet it down in the Table.</p>

                        </table> than real, and doth beſt agree with greater Ordnance; but by help of it, working by the Rule of proportion, you may know the Random of any Piece of Ordnance; by firſt (as we have ſaid before) making one Shot, and meaſuring from your Platform that diſtance. You may make a Table for your Piece thus,</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe a Saker being mounted to 5 degrees, ſhoot the Bullet 416 paces, how far will it ſhoot being mounted 10 degrees?</p>
                     <p>As 722 the Tabular diſtance for 5 degrees of Mounture, is to 416 paces the diſtance found,</p>
                     <p>So is the Tabular diſtance for 10 degrees of Mounture, 1214. to the diſtance required, which will be found to be 699, 5 paces.</p>
                     <p>Now if you deſire to know how much of the Horizontal line, is contained directly under the right line of any Shot, called the right Range, made out of any Piece at any elevation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, know that in plain Triangles, the violent motion or right line of a Shot is ſuppoſed to be the Hypothenuſal, the Angle of Mounture to be the Angle at Baſe; theſe are given, and the Horizontal line is the Baſe which is to be found, there the proportion will run thus;</p>

                     <p>As the Radius 90 deg. is to the number of paces in a right Range;</p>
                     <p>So is the Sine Complement of the Angle of Mounture, to the Horizontal Baſe, or the right line which lyes parallel to the Horizon under the way of the Shot.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the violent, crooked, and natural motion or way of a Shot, from the time he is diſcharged, until it is deſcended.</head>
                     <p>BY the third and fourth propoſitions of the ſecond Book of <hi>Tartagilia,</hi> his <hi>Nova Scientia,</hi> he ſheweth that every body equally heavy, as a Shot in the end of the violent motion thereof, being diſcharged out of a Piece of Ordnance, ſo it be not right up or right down, the curved Range ſhall joyn with the right Range, and to the natural courſe and motion betwixt them both, which diſtinct motions you may ſee in the laſt foregoing figure.</p>
                     <p>In the 17 propoſition of the ſame Book, he proveth that every Shot equally heavy, great or little, equally elevated above the Horizon, or equally oblique or level di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, are among themſelves like, and proportional in their diſtance, as the figure following ſheweth, as A E F is like and proportional in right and crooked Ranges unto H I, and in their diſtances or dead Ranges A F unto A I.</p>
                     <p>And in his 4th and 6th propoſitions of the ſame Book, he proveth that every Shot made upon the level hath the mixt or crooked Range thereof equal to the Arch of a Quadrant 90 degrees; and if it be made upon an elevation above the level, that then it will make the crooked Range to be more than a Quadrant: And if that be made imbaſed under the level, that then the crooked Range thereof will be a Quadrant.</p>
                     <p>And in his 9th propoſition of the ſame Book, he ſhews, that if one Piece be Shot off twice, the one level, and the other at the beſt of her Random at 42 ½ deg. Mounture, that the right Range of the length is but the ½ of the dead range of the beſt Random. He that deſires a further Demonſtration of theſe Propoſitions, may peruſe his ſaid ſecond Book <hi>de Nova Scientia.</hi>

                     <p>BEcauſe the Quadrant cannot be conveniently uſed at all times, eſpecially when the wind blows hard, and, being near the Enemies Guns, the Plumb-line is too long before it ſtands ſtill; to remedy this, the Gunners Rule was invented, the figure hereof is as followeth; it muſt be 12 or 14 inches long, according as the Gun will require, it muſt have a long ſlit down the middle thereof like the Eye-Vane of a Quadrant or back Staff, the head thereof make circular or a little hollow, as you ſee in the figure the Inſtrument is deſcribed ſtanding, at 'tis to be placed upon the Britch of a Piece of Ordnance; in the middle of the ſmall narrow ſlit you muſt place a Lute ſtring or a well twiſted Silk with a Bead running upon the ſame to be ſet to any number of inches and parts, or to ſuch a degree of the Quadrant, as you muſt mount your Gun unto; and on the one ſide of the ſlit you muſt place a diviſion of inches, and let every inch be divided into 10 parts, and then it will ſerve for all ſorts of Guns; but if it be for a particular Gun, then on the other ſide you may place the degrees and parts, when you ſhall find by the length of your Piece, how many inches and parts of an inch goes to a degree; but to uſe it with all ſorts of Ordnance, let it only be divided into inches and parts.</p>

                     <p>The uſe of this Table in graduating the Rule is very plain; for if your Piece of Ordnance be 8 foot long, and you would mount your Piece two degrees, ſeek for 8 foot under the title length of the Piece, and in the common Angle againſt the length of the Piece under two degrees you will find 3, 36, to make a degree; that is 3 inches and 36 parts of an inch, divided into 100 parts, and to this you may ſet your Bead.</p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42528:206"/>
                     <p>The uſe of the graduated Rule is thus: having loaded your <hi>Piece,</hi> and brought your Piece of Ordnance in a right line with your mark, the diſpart being placed upon the Muzzle Ring, in like manner place your Rule upon the Baſe Ring, and let one ſtanding by hold it, for the foot of it let it be fitted round to the Gun; ſo you may be ſure to place it right, and you may eſtimate on its perpendicular well enough; now having before the diſtance to the mark you intend to ſhoot at, and admit you have found it to be 461 paces, and the firſt Shot you made for practice out of that Piece conveyed her Shot at two degrees of Mounture 274 paces; then by our former Rules and the Tables of Randoms, there I find 461 againſt 6 degrees, which is the degrees I muſt mount my Piece to reach 461 paces.</p>
                     <p>Then to find by this Table how many inches and hundred parts of an inch 6 degrees will require, look in the Table above, and find on the left hand in the firſt Column the length of the Piece, and juſt under the degrees (as is aforeſaid) you ſhall find the inches and parts of Mounture, to which ſet your Bead on your ſtring, that is in the ſight, to ſo many inches and parts as the Table gives; then mount the Piece higher or lower, until you bring the Bead to the top of the diſpart and mark, all in one line; ſtop then the Piece in ſuch a poſition with a Coyn, then prime and give fire.</p>
                     <p>If you will ſhoot by the Metal of the Piece without a diſpart, then ſubſtract the height of the diſpart out of the inches found by the Table, and to the remainder mount your Piece.</p>
                     <p>If you have no Quadrant nor a Ruler, and would make a good Shot, look in the Table, and find the length of the Piece and the inches that you ought to raiſe your Piece unto, then cut a peece of ſtick juſt of that length, and ſet it upon the Baſe Ring, and bring the top of that ſtick, the top of the diſpart, and the mark, all in a right line with your eye, and you will make as good a Shot as if you had a Rule and Bead, or Quadrant.</p>
                     <p>If you will have no diſpart, take your diſpart and meaſure it upon the aforeſaid ſtick at the Baſe Ring, and from it cut off the length of the diſpart, and the remainder uſe upon the Baſe Ring.</p>
                     <p>But if the Mounture ſhould be ſo ſmall that the inches of the diſpart ſhould be more than the inches anſwerable to the degrees of Mounture; then cut off from the diſpart ſo much as 'tis longer than the other, and place it upon the Muzzle Ring, and bring the upper part of the Baſe Ring, the diſpart, and mark, in a right line with your Eye, and you will this way make a level with a ſtick without Inſtrument, as well as if you had Ruler or Quadrant.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> How to make a Shot at the Enemies Light in a dark night, and to make at a Company of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Footmen paſſing by, and alſo to make a good Shot at a Ship Sailing; and how a Shot lodged in a Piece, ſo that it will not be driven home to the Powder, may be ſhot out without hurt to the Piece.</head>
                     <p>TO ſhoot by night at the Enemies Lights, diſpart your Piece with a lighted and flaming Wax Candle, or with a lighted Piece of Match, that with your Eye you may bring the Baſe Ring, the fired Match on the Muzzle Ring, and the Enemies Light, in a right line, or mark; then give fire, and you will make a good Shot.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42528:207"/>
                     <p>If you make a Shot at a Company of Horſe paſſing by, take a Piece that will reach the way the Horſe or Foot are coming in a right line, then let your Gun be ſo loaded with Powder as it may preſently take fire, and let your Shot be fit for your uſe; then take notice of ſome Hillock or ſome turning croſs way for the mark, and when the Enemy comes near to that way in a right line with your Gun, give fire; but for ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Ship upon the River, you muſt put your Piece to ſome eminent mark on the other ſide of the River, and when the Head of the Ship ſhall begin to be between the Piece and the mark, then give fire.</p>
                     <p>But if by ſome miſchievous accident a Shot is lodged in the concavity of a Piece, and there ſticks, and will not go home to the Powder, or come out; then the Gunner, to ſave his Piece from breaking, muſt imbaſe the mouth of the Piece, or put it under the line of level, then put in at the Touch-hole fair warm water at ſeveral times, ſo that it may run out at Muzzle or Mouth of the Piece; and when all the Salt-Peter is waſhed from the Powder, which is known by the taſte of the Water, then let the Gunner clear the Touch-hole, and put in as much Powder as poſſible he can, and prime and give fire, and it will ſerve to draw out the Shot.</p>
                     <p>But when a Shot hath lain long in a Piece until he is grown ruſty, and ſo ſticks faſt, put ſtrong Vinegar warm into the mouth of the Piece, and with the Rammer ſtrike the Shot until it doth move; then put in Vinegar until it run clear through the Powder and Shot; prime as before, and give fire with good Powder, and if it do not run through after it hath ſtood three dayes, clear the Touch-hole, prime and give fire.</p>
                     <p>A man may alſo ſhoot farther than ordinary in one and the ſelf ſame Piece, if the Powder be gently driven home, and wadded accordingly; then the Shot being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Paper, Leather, Oakam, or ſuch like, to fill cloſe to the Powder with a good Wadd, putting after it a Tampion of Cork, and with a Spunge moiſten it with Oyl, annoint the vacant Cylender, and ſo Barricado the Piece that it may not reverſe in the Diſcharge.</p>

                        <p>HAving brought your Approaches near unto a Town or a Fortreſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would you chooſe a Bulwark or a Curtain to be battered with your Ordnance?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                        <p>A Town may be aſſaulted in divers places; ſometimes you aſſault one ſide, when as you make your Battery on another; ſometimes you chooſe a Bulwark, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles a Curtain to be battered, with this intention, to take in the Town as ſoon as poſſible may be. As for me, if I were to take in a great Town which is populous, I had rather chooſe to batter a <hi>Curtain,</hi> than a <hi>Bulwark,</hi> which hath a high catt, or mount upon it: eſpecially, ſeeing that in great Towns the Bulwarks lying one far from another, they do ſhow the skirt of the Curtain very open.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>Why would you rather chooſe a Curtain than a Bulwark?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>Becauſe your Bulwarks are alwayes ſtronger, and better fortified than your Curtain, and being it is the principal ſtrength of a place, and better furniſhed with Platforms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Flanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will require more time, labour, and charge to batter, than your Curtain.</p>

                        <p>But what General is ſo ill experienced, as to labour to batter a Curtain, having two ſtrong Bulwarks on both ſides of him, to flanker him when he is to put over his Gallery, and to give an aſſault upon the Curtain: peradventure for his labour and pains, he may be well beaten.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>Soft (Good Sir,) Suppoſe that after a great deal of labour and pains you have battered a Bulwark, and falling up to the breach to aſſault it, you find it cut off, an Enemy lodged in it, muſt you not then begin to ſap forward again, to make a new batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? whereas on a Curtain there is not that means of cutting it off, as upon a large Bulwark.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>Have you ever ſeen the experience of it?</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Yes Sir, the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>took in the</hi> Boſch <hi>by a Bulwark, and alſo</hi> Breda, <hi>but</hi> Maſtrick <hi>was taken in by making a breach, and ſpringing of a mine, upon the Curtain between</hi> Jonger <hi>Port and a Bulwark;</hi> howſoever the Town of <hi>Cortes</hi> upon the frontiers of <hi>Franee,</hi> was firſt battered by the <hi>Arch-duke of Auſtria</hi> upon the point of a Bulwark, near unto the very joynt of the Curtain, where a high and a ſtrong turret ſtood, which did annoy us much, ſo that we could not advance forward, but were conſtrained to leave off our approach on that ſide, and began to make a new Battery for a breach in a Curtain on the Field-ſide, where there lay a ſtrong Bulwark to defend it, which did our men a great deal of harm; but howſoever, with great difficulty and much ado, we took in the Town that way, by lodging our ſelves in the Curtain. Likewiſe the City of <hi>Cambray</hi> was battered, and taken in upon a Curtain, for all there were two ſtrong Bulwarks that flankered it, which if we had run our line upon a Bulwark, we ſhould not have forced it ſo ſoon; yea ſuch an occaſion might preſent it ſelf, that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may be forced to batter both the one and the other, or to find out ſome ſecret way by undermining a wall, and blowing it up with powder.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>This is for your great Towns; but what ſay you to a Caſtle, a Cittadel, or ſome narrow Fortreſs, how will you go to work to take in thoſe with the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>As for your Forts, and Caſtles, it is much better to batter them upon a mount or a Bulwark, than upon a Curtain: my reaſon is this, that in theſe your Bulwarks lying cloſe one by another, will flank one another with the greater force, and hide the Curtain much better to defend it, ſo that one cannot ſo eaſily force it, if the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes be not taken away.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>Go to then; a Town then being to be battered, either upon a Curtain or a Bulwark, how many Pieces of Ordnance would you have to do it, and, how and in what manner would you place, and plant your Ordnance upon your batteries to make a good breach?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>To effect this, I would have 18 Pieces of Canon and half Canon, (<hi>for leſſer Pieces for Battery are now grown out of uſe.</hi>)</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>Whether would you chooſe more whole Canon or half Canon?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>To batter a place well either upon a ſtony or earthy wall, you may aſſure your ſelf, the more whole Cannon you have, the greater and the more ſufficient your breach will be: for your great battering Pieces do ſpoil and beat down any thing, which doth meet with their great force and violence: <hi>Howſoever of late years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught at divers Seiges that your half Canon which are more portable, having good ſtore of them, will do the buſineſs aſwell as your whole Canon.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>But at what diſtance would you make your Batteries, for theſe 18 Pieces of Canon, and how near unto the place, which you intend to Batter.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>I would counſel a General to approach as near unto that place as poſſible may be, and make his Batteries ſome two or three hundred paces one from another, and that if it were poſſible to advance covertly the Approach and ſap, even up to the Counter-ſcharfe, and very brink of the Moat, to prepare a way for his Gallery: not only to Batter that place being at hand with the greater force, but alſo to keep in, and hinder an Enemy from Sallying out upon the Beſiegers, to diſcover and diſmount their Ordnance in <hi>Caſemates,</hi> or if they have ſunk any in their Walls or Falſe-bray, and ſo to terrifie them, that they dare not ſtir out.</p>

                        <p>I am alſo of your opinion, and hold it for good, yet I fear this will not be ſo ſoon done, and is ſooner ſpoken, than executed, and that before you can bring your approach and ſap ſo far, it will coſt you warm blood, and a great many mens lives, if you have a ſtout Enemy within to deal withal, and one that is very Vigilant, and careful to ſtand upon his Guard, and his defence.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis true, this cannot be done without danger, and the loſs of men, but he that is fearful muſt ſtay at home, and not come into the Wars where there is neither place nor time, which doth free or exempt him from danger: yet the danger is not alwayes ſo great, eſpecially in ſuch places, where you have Earth enough to work with, to caſt up your ſapps, and to heighten and deepen your Approaches, which will ſhow you the way, for the more higher you find the ground in Approaching to the edge of the moat, the deeper Trenches you may make, and cover your ſelf by caſting up of blinds continually, to keep you from the ſight of the Beſieged; and it is better, when you have brought your approach as it were under them, than if you were 200 or 300 paces diſtant from them.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>

                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>I would make a great Battery with 8 of them to beat upon a right line, either upon a Curtain, or the point of a Bulwark (which the General ſhall find fitteſt) Two Batteries with each 3 Canon to play ſlope-wiſe from the great Battery; as the ninth plate and 28 and 29 figures ſhows, and two Batteries, with two half Canon a Piece, to play as it were croſs-wiſe upon the breach. And thus you ſee your 18 Pieces planted upon 5 Batteries, as you may obſerve in the 9th. Plate, and the two Figures of a Curtain and of a Bulwark following.</p>

                        <p>Good Sir tell me I pray you how many ſhot will theſe 18 Pieces of Canon make in 10 hours, and how much powder will they require.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>In 10 hours they may make ſome 1500 ſhot, and will require a matter of 25000 pound weight of powder, that is 150 barrels full, each barrel containing 160 pound weight in it.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>You make your account then that every Piece in the ſpace of 10 hours is to ſhoot 80 ſhot, that is 8 ſhot an hour for every Piece.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>You may make 10 ſhot in an hour if you pleaſe, if your Pieces be renforced; but as for your ordinary Pieces, they have not metalline ſubſtance enough to bear it: conſidering alſo that after you have made 40 ſhot out of a Piece, it will be ſo heated, that it muſt have a cooling time, which muſt be at leaſt an hour, for otherwiſe your Piece being grown over hot, it may cauſe danger.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>Methinks that 80 ſhot for a Piece in ſo long a time were too little, having often heard, that in that while, a Piece may well be ſhot off 130 times; can you give me your reſolution upon this?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <p>I will tell you Sir what hapned once in the Iſland of <hi>Bomble,</hi> Anno 1599. we planted a Piece by a mill, by which we did annoy the Enemy very much, ſo that they were forced to make a Battery, and planted a whole Canon, and a demy-Canon upon it, ſeeking to diſmount ours. Now ſhooting with this Piece from four of the clock in the morning, till eleven toward noon, this Piece had a cooling time the ſpace of two hours, and about one of the clock we began to play with it again, and continued ſhooting with it till 4 a clock in the afternoon; but this Piece being not able to endure the force and heating of ſo many ſhot, we were conſtrained to leave off with it: and yet ceaſed not ſhooting with our other Pieces from another Battery by command from <hi>Don Lewes de Valaſco,</hi> General of our Ordnance, and ſhooting croſs-wiſe with ſome other of our Pieces, we put the Enemies two Pieces to ſilence in the ſpace of an hour; a Souldier of ours ſtanding by, was curious to keep a tally of the number of all the ſhot we made from the morning till four a clock in the afternoon, and ſhewed me 80 notches, which deducting the two hours cooling, our Piece planted at the Mill made 8 ſhot in an hour, which was as much as could be required of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Senior</hi> Diego Uffano <hi>give your Tranſlator leave to interrupt you a little, and ſo to conclude this diſcourſe. If you remember at the Seige of</hi> Oſtend, <hi>which you mention ofttn
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42528:208"/> in your Chapters and Dialogues, you were without, and I was within the Town, that on the ſeventh of</hi> January, Anno 1602. Stilo Novo, <hi>After Sir</hi> Francis Vere <hi>of famous memory (who defended and kept the Town againſt you) had deluded you with a</hi> Parley, <hi>only to gain time, and to make up our Canon and Sea-beaten works along the skirt of the old Town, his Highneſs the Archduke reſolved to aſſault us, and that morning began to batter</hi> Sand-hill <hi>and</hi> Schotenburgh, <hi>to make a breach for yoù againſt that night, with intent to Aſſault us (as you did) and to have entred the Town, and have put us all to the Sword, the Relation whereof you ſhall hear in the end of this Book. Now you had placed and planted your</hi> 20 <hi>Pieces of Cannon to batter them in this manner,</hi> 8 <hi>from your Battery at the foot of the</hi> Downs, 8 <hi>from a Battery on the right hand of the</hi> Downs, 6 <hi>from your pile Battery,</hi> 6 <hi>more which you had made upon the Sand, and as it were raiſed out of the Sea: the firſt ſhot upon the breach in a right line, and the other two ſlope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as your two figures following do demonſtrate. Theſe</hi> 20 <hi>Pieces of Canon towards noon had a cooling time, for a matter of ſome</hi> 2 <hi>hours, juſt as you have ſaid; and afterwards you began to batter the breach and old Town again, till it was almoſt twilight, and then they cooled again, till you were ready to give us an aſſault; and before you fell on, as I do well remember, you ſhot off one of your Cannons with a hollow Bullet, which flew over the Town and made a great humming noiſe, as a warning Piece to the</hi> Count of Bucquoy, <hi>who lay on the Eaſt-ſide, that you were then ready to fall on, and that he ſhould do the like, this was your Signal. Now</hi> General Vere <hi>knowing well your intent, gave order to the Gentleman of our Ordnance who had the guard upon</hi> Sand-hill, <hi>that he ſhould keep a true Tally, and an account of all the ſhot you made that day, with your</hi> 20 <hi>Pieces of Cannon upon the breach and the old Town, which being caſt up, there were found to be made that day from morning till night</hi> 2200 <hi>ſhot, which was found to be an</hi> 110 <hi>ſhot for every Piece, and</hi> 11 <hi>ſhot an hour for every Piece, which is more than</hi> 8; <hi>but I verily believe your Pieces were renforced.</hi> This by the way, and ſo I return again to your own Dialogue.</p>

                        <p>(Good Sir) I pray ſhow me how you would batter the point of a Bulwark (as the figure 28 following demonſtrates,) and give me ſome reaſons aſwel defenſive as offenſive.</p>

                        <p>I am willing to give your Lordſhip content, and ſay, If I were to batter the point of a <hi>Bulwark</hi> or a <hi>Baſtion,</hi> I would have the ſame number of battering Canon, and planted in the ſame form and manner as they were for the Curtain, and to ſhoot ſloap and croſs-wiſe alſo; and if your approaches were advanced ſo far, they ſhould be planted upon the very brink of the moat and upon the <hi>Counterſcharfe,</hi> I would plant 4 of them ſo, that they ſhould diſmount the Enemies Canon in their <hi>Caſemates,</hi> or any, if they had ſunk them in their <hi>Falſebray,</hi> which ſhould wait upon that occaſion.</p>

                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>I am of your mind, and prefer ſuch a batter before all others, who are of the opinion that they had rather chooſe a Curtain than a Bulwark to be battered.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>You have heard my reaſons for that, and ſee the figures following traced out to you. But as for your <hi>Bulwark</hi> the <hi>beſieged</hi> may cut it off (as you may mark in the figures of <hi>Retrenchments</hi> and <hi>Cuttings off</hi> in the ſecond part of this book) for indeed it will be a hard matter to force an Enemy out of a Bulwark, who is reſolved to looſe it by peecemeal and degrees; and there is not ſo much danger in aſſaulting of a Curtain, which being once well battered and beaten down with your Ordnance, you have an eaſier way and entrance to fall on with your Troops of men, to enter the Town or Fortreſs; but for the defence which is made from your Flanking Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, or your Caſemates, you muſt make Batteries upon the brink of the moat againſt them, (as is ſaid) to diſmount the Enemies Pieces, and to flanker with your Ordnance the Parapets of the Bulworks to beat them about their ears, that the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works may lye the more open to you, and I think this way is the leaſt danger.</p>

                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>But the Beſieged, their cuttings off, may they not be made aſwel upon a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as upon a Bulwark.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>No, for the Rampire being thinner, you have neither ſo much ground, nor the like accommodation in a Curtain as in a Bulwark; and indeed, a Governour
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42528:209"/> of a Town, or of a Fortreſs, if he were put to his choice, had rather to be aſſaulted on a Bulwark (than on a Curtain) by cutting it off into the form of a half moon, that he might make a new reſiſtance, and defend it with a leſs number of men. Beſides, in a Bulwark the Beſieged have this advantage over the Aſſailants, which is very dangerous for them, that they may make a Mine within the bowels of their Bulwark when an Enemy ſhall attempt to aſſault it, and thinking to enter the Breach and take the Town, they may be blown up into the Air by a Countermine; the like alſo may happen to the Beſieged, the Aſſailants ſpringing their Mine alſo in a Bulwark, when they think they ſtand upon their beſt defence.</p>

                        <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>May not the like be done alſo in a Curtain?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>No, it will not take the like effect as in a Bulwark; for a Breach being once made in a Curtain, for as an Enemy may aſſault it at large, ſo they may bring a greater number of men to fight, to help to defend it; whereas in a Bulwark they are pen'd up and ſtraightned in a narrow place, which may be cut off, and will require a fewer number of men to defend it, whereas thoſe which are to force it, muſt be conſtrained to bring up a great many men to aſſault, who in an inſtant may be in danger of blowing up.</p>

                        <p>Your reaſons (Good Captain) are not to be ſlighted; but as for me, I hold it ſafer, to batter and aſſault the breach of a Bulwark, than of a Curtain. For though the beſieged may cut it off, and defend it with a fewer number of men, yet the Aſſaulters have this advantage over the Beſieged defendants, that they have more place and elbow room, and may find a leſs reſiſtance than in a Curtain, ſeeing that one may make as a great a breach in a Bulwark as in a Curtain, becauſe your Ordnance may beat it flat, and level with the ground; and chooſing rather a Bulwark: I will herewith conclude this diſcourſe, and now ſhew you the figures both of the one, and of the other in this following plate.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Containing the demonſtration of Morters, and the uſe of them.</head>
                     <p>YOur great and ſmall Morters, are not only ſerviceable in a War offenſive, by ſhooting and caſting of great Granadoes, as of 100, 150, 170 pound weight, and ſmaller of 40, and 50 pound; but alſo by caſting of Fire-balls, Stones, old Rubbidge, and Pieces of Iron, into Cities, Towns, and Fortreſſes; and may be uſed alſo defenſively, to be ſhot from Towns and Forts into any Enemies works, and approaches; eſpecially they are of ſingular uſe, when an Enemy hath covertly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and lodged himſelf under ſome Bulwark, Tower, or Turret, and is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to undermine them; which if they do, you may plant one of theſe Morters at a reaſonable diſtance, on the inſide of your Wall, and ſhooting your Granado, as it were bolt upright into the air, by its natural fall, it may light juſt into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies works, and there with great violence breaking among them, it will make them cry, fly, and forſake the place; you may alſo fire them out of a place, by caſting good ſtore of Hand Granadoes down among them, and ſo annoy them, that the work will be too hot for them.</p>

                     </figure>
                     <p>The uſe of them is not to ſhoot in a right line, as other Ordnance do, but in an oblique line, as you may ſee by the two Figures following, unleſs your Morter be mounted to 90 degrees, mounting them uſually above 45 degrees, namely to 60, 70, 80, and ſometimes more or leſs, as the diſtance and fall of your Granado or Shot ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>Having before ſhown you the making and uſe of the Quadrant, it remains now that I come to the charging and uſe of a Morter; now before you put in your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it muſt be well ſponged and cleared, whether you charge it with looſe Powder, or Cartouch, turning the mouth almoſt bolt upright; the Powder being put into the Chamber, you muſt ſtop it with a Wadd either of Hay or Oakam, and after a Tampkin of ſome ſoft wood, and this with the Powder that was put in firſt, it muſt fill up the whole Chamber thereof, that there may be no vacuity between the Powder and the Wadd, or between the Wadd and the Shot; this done, the ſhot ſhall be put in at the mouth, with another Wadd after it; but you muſt have a care that your Morter be not much mounted, leſt your ſhot flyes out too ſoon, and the Wadd between the Tampkin and the ſhot will not only ſave the ſhot from the Tampkins breaking of it, but alſo is to avoid vacuities which may endanger the breaking of the Piece by ſecond expanſions.</p>
                     <p>Now then having reſolved of the premiſſes, touching your Piece, Shot, and Powder, as aboveſaid, and upon the diſtance and mounture of your mark, as the Rules and Tables following ſhall direct you, then for the bending and diſpoſing of it to the aſſigned mark; lay firſt a ſtraight Ruler upon the Mouth of your Morter, and upon it place a Quadrant (as you may ſee by the Figures) or ſome other Inſtrument croſs-wiſe, to ſet the Morter upright, for ſhuning of wide ſhooting, and then placing them fore-right to elevate it into the reſolved degree of Mounture, to avoid ſhort or overſhooting, accordingly as the Tables following will teach you; for having made one ſhot, you may thereby proportion the reſt, conſidering whether you are to ſhoot with or againſt the wind, or whether it blows towards the right or the left hand, whether weakly or ſtrongly, and ſo accordingly to give or abate the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or diſadvantage, which judgment and diſcretion will induce you thereunto, and the help of the Rules following.</p>
                     <p>Now we will come to the uſe of a Morter, and that in this example following; Suppoſe an Enemy be approached to the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or foot of a Wall or a Bulwark, and there is a rooting, and begins to make a Mine, and having Chambred his Powder, intends to blow it up, and that there is no other means left you, to repulſe and hinder their egreſs and regreſs into it; but by ſhooting out of your Morters ſome Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Stones, and Rubbiſh among them, or at leaſt by caſting many Hand-Granadoes down upon them. To do this either by force or policy, it behoveth a good Canonier or Fire-worker, to know firſt (as hath been taught) how far his Morter will carry a Granado, or any ſolid thing elſe, which ſhall be ſhot out of it, being ſet upon ſuch and ſuch a degree and elevation as the Morter Figure will ſhew you. As for Example, take your aim level with the mould or mouth of your Morter, noted A upon the Quadrant, and it will carry 200 paces, where you ſee the Granado falls upon the letter A; but your morter being elevated to the mark B, it then will carry its Bullet 487 paces; if to the ſecond C, then 755 paces; if to the third D, it will carry 937 paces; if to the fourth E, then 1065 paces; if to the fifth elevation F, then 1132 paces; if to the ſixth G, which is in the midſt of the Quadrant, and lyes then upon its higheſt elevation, it will carry 1170 paces, as you may ſee by the ſeveral falls of the Bullets upon every Letter. The ſecond Figure ſhews you a Morter caſting a Granado upon a Caſtle, as you may ſee by the Example.</p>

We ſhall therefore be contented to make choice of ſome of the beſt and principal things among ſo great a number, but more particularly of ſome moſt admirable inventions; and we ſhall give a Chapter to every kind of Fire-work, conſidering they differ among themſelves both in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effect, and every one hath its name which is particularly applyed to it. But before we begin with our compoſition we ſhall begin with the particulars, and their preparation unto this work, whereby they may be the more exalted, and have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter efficacy. The more principal materials, that is, Peter, Charcoal and Sulphur, are mentioned at large in my firſt part of Gunnery, and therefore we ſhall proceed.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. To prepare Oyl of Sulphur.</head>
                     <p>TAke a good quantity of clarified Sulphur, (the way of Clarification we have ſhewed before) melt it over a very gentle fire in an Earthen or Copper Veſſel, then take old red Tyles that have been already uſed in buildings, or if you cannot find ſuch, take new Tyles that are well baked, and that have not taken dirt, break them in pieces as ſmall as a Bean, and throw them into melted Brimſtone, then min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle your Brimſtone with the remaining fragments of the Bricks, until they have drank up all the Sulphur, then let them be put into a Limbeck upon a Furnace to diſtil, and after the Oyl is drawn according to a Chymical order it will be very excellent, and above all, have a very combuſtible quality, proper to the Compoſitions of artificial fires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To prepare Oyl or Balſam of Sulphur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fill a long body of Glaſs full of Sulphur well powdered, then pour upon it Oyl of Turpentine, or Oyl of nuts, or Juniper, in ſuch a quantity that the oyl with the Sulphur may fill but the half part, place it in an Iron Kettle, with Sand round about it, and a ſmall heat for 8 or 9 hours, and you will ſee that the Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine will convert the Brimſtone into a red Oyl, as fiery and combuſtible as before.</p>
                     <p>There are thoſe that take the following matter to the preparing the oyl of Sulphur, to the end it may be rendered more combuſtible, <hi>viz.</hi> Sulphur 1 <hi>l.</hi> of quick Lyme half a pound, of Sal-armoniac 4 ounces.</p>
                     <p>Above all this, the Chymiſts know how to prepare a certain oyl of Sulphur, (which they call a Balſam) of which the virtues are ſo admirable, that they admit not any body, either living or dead, to be touched with putrifaction, but will conſerve it in ſo perfect and entire ſtate, that neither the pernicious Influences of the celeſtial bodies, nor that corruption which the Elements produce, nor that which reduces things into their Principles, can any way damnifie it, if anoynted with it. There is alſo from it prepared a certain fire (as <hi>Tritemius</hi> teacheth) with flowers of <hi>Sulphur, Borax</hi> and <hi>Brandy-wine,</hi> which will remain many years without extinguiſhing of it ſelf. Others that are knowing, do atteſt that a Lamp may be filled with ſuch like Oyl, from whence all that are within the Light of it, will appear as if they had no heads.</p>
                     <p>There is another way of making Oyl of Sulphur which is very admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, which is prepared thus. Incorporate well together an equal proportion of Sulphur and Salt-Peter, reduce them into moſt ſubtile Powder, and paſs it through a fine ſieve, then put them into an Earthen Pot that hath never been uſed, and pour upon them Vinegar made of <hi>White-wine</hi> or <hi>Aqua-vita,</hi> as much as will cover the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Cloſe the Pot in ſuch manner that no air may any wiſe enter, and put it thus in any hot place ſo long time until all the vinegar be digeſted and vaniſhed. Laſtly, take that matter which reſts in the Pot, and draw from thence an oyl, by Chymical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper to this work.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The preparation of the Flowers of Benjamin.</head>
                     <p>TAke Benjamin a certain quantity of ounces, put it into a Gourd or a Limbeck glaſs, and cloſe it well with a blind head (as they call it) then have in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an earthen veſſel, ſet it upon a Tresfoot, or for the more certainty upon a ſmall Furnace, place it in your glaſs body, and compaſs it well about with fine Sand or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes ſo high as the matter is in the glaſs; after make a moderate fire under it, for fear the Limbeck heat too ſoon, and be too hot, for that will make the flowers become citrine or yellow, when they ought to be as white as Snow. Obſerve when you ſee the flowers begin to raiſe a vapour or ſmall fume, continue your fire in that ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the ſpace of one quarter of an hour; after you ſhall ſee the flowers riſen unto the internal Superficies of the blind head, then take it away carefully, and put to it another that ſhall be quite cold, and put that which you have taken off upon a white paper until it be cold, then gently with a Feather or wooden Spatula, cauſe the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to come forth of the blind head, and gather them together carefully: thus you may add a third or fourth blind head, and in time many, until all the Benjamin ceaſe to fume.</p>
                     <p>Benjamin may be made into flowers another way, thus; put into a glazed pot a certain quantity of ounces of Benjamin, and place it upon warm aſhes, and when you ſee it begin to fume, cover the veſſel with a Cornet of paper made in the form of a Cone, and a little larger than the orifice of the pot, leave it there about one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, after take off the Cornet, and take the flowers and gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then put upon the veſſel another Cornet of paper, and let it ſtand as long as before; take it off, and gather the flowers to the former, and continue thus putting Cornet after Cornet, until your flowers be entirely evaporated.</p>

                     <p>TAke Juniper Gumm (which is called ſomtimes) Sandarach, white varniſh, or Maſtick moſt ſubtilly powdered 2 <hi>l.</hi> white diſtilled vinegar as much as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cover the Gumm in a glaſs, ſet it deep in horſe-dung the ſpace of 20 days; then take it and pour it forth into another glaſs Veſſel with a wide mouth, and let it ſtand thus in digeſtion a whole moneth, and in it you ſhall have Camphire congealed in form of a Cruſt of bread, and which hath in ſome meaſure the reſemblance of the verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or true Camphire. The Camphire hath ſuch a love for the fire, that being once lighted, it goeth not out until it be quite conſumed. The flame that comes from thence is very clear, and of a very agreeable odour; after it hath remained ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the air ſome time it vaniſheth inſenſibly. The cauſe that produceth all theſe rare effects from Camphire, is by reaſon its parts are extream ſubtil and airy.</p>
                     <p>I do add to all this, that it may be eaſie to reduce Camphire into Powder, to make it uſeful in artificial fireworks; if a man crumbles it and beats it gently, rouling it with Sulphur. The oyl of Camphire, which ſerves alſo for the ſame effect, is made by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little of oyl of ſweet Almonds, and ſtir them well together in a braſs Morter, and peſtle of the ſame metal, until all be converted into oyl of a greeniſh colour.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42528:214"/>
                     <p>Or a man may put it into a Glaſs Viol which muſt be cloſe ſtopped, provided alſo that the Camphire be true and natural, and not a Cheat; then put that Glaſs into a warm Furnace, and draw it out, when you ſhall ſee all the Camphire turned into a pure clear oyl, which will burn with an admirable vivacity.</p>

                     <p>THe Hand Granadoes reſpecting their form, are Globically or perfectly round and hollow in their interior part in manner of a Sphere; they are called Hand Granadoes, or Handy Granadoes, becauſe they may be graſped in the hand, and thrown to the Enemies; and if we ſhould dwell upon the denominations of the Latine, we may call them as they do, <hi>Granades Palmares,</hi> they are commonly of the bigneſs of a Bullet of Iron of 5, 6, and 8 <hi>l.</hi> they weigh ſometimes 1 <hi>l.</hi> and ſometimes one pound and a half, ſome are of two pounds, and others of three pounds; there is given to theſe ſort of Globes the names of <hi>Granadoes,</hi> by reaſon of the great reſemblance they have with the Fruit <hi>Punique,</hi> which we call <hi>Pom-granad;</hi> for as theſe do ſhut up in their rinds a great quantity of grains; ſo our Military Globes are filled with a number of Grains of Powder, almoſt innumerable, the which having received the Fire, do break into a thouſand and a thouſand ſhivers, leaping againſt the Enemy, and piercing if it could all ſuch things as it meets oppoſing its violence. They are generally made of Iron or Copper, carrying in its Diameter about three Ounces, being about the length of a Barly Corn in thickneſs of Metal; they are filled commonly with Gun-Powder, and ſometimes of other Compoſitions, there is added to its Orifice a ſmall Pipe commonly called a Fuſe, which is filled with a matter or Compoſition that is ſlack or ſlow in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but nevertheleſs very ſuſceptible of the Fire, and capable to hold fire ſome time, for fear that it ſhould break in the hands of thoſe that mannage it, and intend to throw it.</p>
                     <p>There is amongſt Fire-Maſters accounted three ſorts of Hand Granadoes, the firſt and moſt common are made of Iron; others are made of Braſs, allayed with other Metals in the melting; the third ſort is of Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>If you cauſe them to be made of Iron, take ſuch as is moſt fragile, and as little wrought as poſſible you can get; if you will caſt them of Copper, you muſt allay ſix pound of Copper, with two pounds of Tyn, and half a pound of Marcaſite, or you may put one part of Tyn with three parts of Lattin or of <hi>Auricalque.</hi> Thoſe that are made of Iron are in thickneſs about the ninth part of the Diameter; thoſe that are made of Braſs muſt have one tenth part of the Diameter in thickneſs of Metal. Laſtly, ſuch which you cauſe to be made of Glaſs, muſt have one ſeventh part of their Diameter in their thickneſs.</p>
                     <p>The largeneſs of the Orifice in which you muſt put in your Fuſe made of Wood, whoſe upper part muſt be about 2/9 the Diameter of the Granado, and the ſmall hole in the Fuſe ſhould have the largeneſs of 1/18 of the ſame Diameter, the reſt of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Shell muſt be filled with well grain'd Powder, the length of the Fuſe muſt be about ⅔ of the Diameter, and the top muſt be broad, and a little rounding like a Hemiſphere, the hollow and inner part of the Fuſe muſt be about 1/9 Diameter at the ſmall or inner end, and ⅔ at the outer end: Men do generally fill the void place with Powder ground moſt ſubtilly, which muſt be moiſtned with Gum-water, or diſſolved glue, that it may joyn the better. As for the Fuſes, they muſt be filled or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with one of the Compoſitions hereunder written; afterward you muſt faſten it well and cloſe with Tow or Okham, and the Pyrotechnian Lute which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Kit,</hi> which is made of four parts of Ship Pitch, two parts of Colophonia, one part of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebinthe, and one part of Wax; you muſt put all theſe Ingredients in a glazed Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and melt them upon a ſmall fire, then mix and mingle them well together.</p>

I ſuppoſe it not neceſſary to ſay much of the uſe of this Granado, and ſince it is ſo eaſie to be underſtood by what we have ſaid, and that the occaſion you will have of ſuch things will forge your Inventions enough to put them in practice.</p>

                     <p>ACcording to the definition which we have given of them, it is moſt evident, and I ſuppoſe no body will doubt, that they are to be taken in the hand, and that we muſt graſp them to throw them at the Enemy. It is ſaid before that this kind of Arms is as well defenſive as offenſive; therefore we ſhall not reſt upon the proof of theſe things; thoſe that have been at the managing of them muſt inſtruct them that are ignorant.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall ſay only this, that the Places where theſe Hand Granadoes are uſed at Sea, are where Ships are Board and Board to clear the Enemies Decks, ſo that the way may be cleared there. Upon Land Service they are uſed immediately after the good and happy ſucceſs of a Mine which hath made a great overture in a Rampire, overthrowing one part of the Wall, Bulwark, or Baſtion, to give place to the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, to do their endeavour to get into the breach; it is there that the Beſieged as well as Beſiegers may make uſe of theſe Hand Granadoes; 'tis there where you ſhall ſee the more generous of both ſides armed with Fire and Flames, defending valiantly the quarrel of their Prince, the intereſt of their Party, their Liberties and their Lives. They are imployed alſo upon other occaſions, to wit, when the Beſiegers are come up to the Walls of the Rampire, and ſo well placed, that making winding Stairs in the thickneſs of the Platform, they mount inſenſibly by retact; ſo that the Beſieged cannot any way hinder by the defence of their Flanks, nor be kept ſafe by the Rampires themſelves. Upon theſe occaſions I ſay, the Beſieged ought to pour down a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42528:216"/> a quantity of Hand Granadoes from aloft, or from the top of the Walls, upon their under-miners.</p>
                     <p>And ſometimes they are alſo thrown at a diſtance greater than ordinary, according to the occaſion; but when this cannot be done by the natural ſtrength of a Soldier, without the aid of ſome artificial Inſtrument, the Maſters in this Art have invented certain ſmall Engines, made like unto one of our Ducking-Stools, with a Rope at one end to pluck it down by force, and at the other end a hollow place to lay the Balls in that are to be thrown, and with this Engine well contrived, one may throw upon the Enemy, not only Hand Granadoes; but alſo a quantity of other Artificial Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Fires, as gliſtring or ſhining Globes, Bombards, Fire-pots, and many other ſuch like things, of which we ſhall ſpeak in their place, may be thrown at a greater diſtance than is poſſible by the hand only.</p>
                     <p>This Inſtrument is not very difficult to make, it may eaſily be comprehended by what we have ſaid. I ſhall only advertiſe you of one thing, that the longer the arm of the Engine is on that ſide that is to hold the Granadoes, more than the other part to which the Rope is faſtned, the greater force the Engine will have; but you muſt underſtand this meaſure to be made from Axes or Iron Rolls, upon which the Arm moves.</p>

                     <p>DIſſolve upon the fire in a Braſs or Earthen Veſſel an equal portion of Sulphur, black Pitch, Rozin, and Turpentine; then take a Ball of Stone or Iron, that the Diameter be far leſs than the Diameter of a Cannon, or Morter Piece, for which you intend this Globe; plunge this Shot in this melted matter until it be all over cover'd with the matter about its exterior part, draw it from thence, and role it gently in Corn Powder, that done, cover it all over with a Cotton Cloath; then plunge it again in your Compoſition, and reiterate the rolling it in Powder, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then cover it a ſecond time with another Cotton Cloath; and thus continue dipping your Bullet, and wrapping it about with Cloath, until your Shot has acquired a juſt bigneſs, exactly to fill the Orifice of the Engine, remembring that the laſt Coat of the Shot muſt be of Corn'd Powder: Being then thus prepared, it muſt be put into the Cannon or Morter Piece naked, without any other thing compaſſing it, immediately upon the Powder in the Chamber, which muſt make the Bullet come forth; Then give fire freely to your Piece, to throw the ſhot where you intend it.</p>

                     <p>IT is accuſtomed to do great execution by favour of the night, in occurrences of War, as well as in many other occaſions: I mean not here to ſpeak of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night, for that is naturally effected by the firſt Cauſer of all things, from the order that he hath eſtabliſhed amongſt the Beings; but I intend only here to treat of the darkneſs that is made Artificially, and particularly ſuch as may be produced and made to laſt a little time in a cloſe or narrow place, according to the Rules of our Art, to be made for the blinding of the Enemy, which would force into our beings, and would attaque us by main ſtrength, in a deſign to take away our Lives, Honour, and Goods; or when we have a deſign to facilitate the paſſage for the Aſſailants, in confounding or oppreſſing the Beſieged in their Forts, with a cloudy and thick fume, in ſuch a ſort that one may take them as amazed Fiſh in troubled waters. For this purpoſe are Globes prepared, which whil'ſt they are on fire, produce a ſmoak ſo vehement and unpleaſant, and in ſo great aboundance, that 'tis impoſſible to withſtand the incommodity without burſting aſunder; ſee here the Method. Take Ship Pitch in the Stone 4 <hi>l.</hi> Liquid Pitch 2 <hi>l.</hi> Colophonia 6 <hi>l.</hi> Sulphur 8 <hi>l.</hi> Salt-Peter 36 <hi>l.</hi> melt all theſe Drugs upon burning Coals in any veſſel whatſoever, adding after 10 <hi>l.</hi> of Coal of Sawduſt made of the Pine or Firr-Tree 6 <hi>l.</hi> Crude Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony 2 <hi>l.</hi> incorporate and mix them very well together; then put into this melted matter Tow, Hemp, and Linnen Cloaths a great quantity, and boyl them well in this Compoſition, and when they have drank up all the matter, then form them into Balls of ſuch a bigneſs as you pleaſe, ſo that it may be caſt with the hand, or with the Engine mentioned in the laſt Chapter, according as you ſhall find moſt convenient. And this is our true way to make Night at Noon-day, to obſcure the Sun it ſelf, and to blind the Eyes of the Enemies for ſome time. And this is the moſt lawful way that one may follow, becauſe it ſhews its original from natural things, and we may believe that it is alwayes ſufficient juſtice, ſo that the Wars where ſuch things are practiſed, be not unjuſtly enterprized.</p>

                     <p>IT is a practice that hath been practiſed in former times to ſhoot red hot Fire-balls, and was counted of great defence, as you may find amongſt many other things in the Works of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>Tyrios immiſſe in Alexandri Magni machinamenta maſſas magnas ferreas candentes:</hi> Out of many Authors may be proved the cuſtomary uſe in former times of Shooting red hot Pieces of Iron, which we ſhall not dwell upon, but come to the Practice. Firſt, you muſt Charge the Piece of Ordnance according to the cuſtomary manner, his due proportion of Powder, upon this Powder you muſt put a Wooden Cylender or Fidd, of a juſt and equal wideneſs with the bore of the Piece, which muſt be driven very ſtiff home to the Powder, and for your better ſecurity, you muſt put upon this another wad made of Straw, Hay, or of Oakam, or Tow; this being done, let the Piece be laid a little under Metal, and then cleanſe the vacant place or hollow of the Piece with a Spunge, ſo that all the Grains of Powder that are there, may be taken away. This being done, lay your Piece to bear with the place you intend to ſhoot at, according to the method we have given in the ſecond Part of Gunnery, and let your Piece thus remain until you have put in your red hot Bullet: your Bullet muſt be ſure to be exactly round, and not ſo high, but that it may run freely down in the Piece to the wad, the Shot being red hot, take it out of the fire with a pair of Tongs made for that purpoſe, and put it into the Piece, and give an attentive Ear, for as ſoon as the Shot is ſuppoſed to be up to the Wad, give immediately Fire to your Piece of Ordnance.</p>
                     <p>There are others which put into their Pieces Boxes made of Plate, of Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Others do put into their Pieces Potters Clay, and upon them the fiery Bullet, which with a quick hand they thruſt home with a Rammer, which ought to be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from fire by lining the Rammer head with Copper. But theſe are more perillous; and therefore we account that method above to be the beſt, and moſt free from danger.</p>

                     <p>TO arm Pikes, to defend a ſhip, or breach, or to enter the ſame, or to ſtick in the ſides of a ſhip, or other place, take ſtrong Canvas, and cut it in length about a foot, or 14 inches, and ſix inches high in the Center, and let the ends be both cut taper-wiſe, then faſten the Canvas at both ends with ſtrong twine, and fill it with this receipt.</p>
                     <p>Powder bruiſed 8 parts, Peter in Roch 1 part, Peter in meal 1 part, Sulphur in meal two parts, Rozen Roch three parts, Turpentine 1 part, Verdigreaſe ½ part, Bole-armonick ⅓ part, Bay ſalt ⅓ part, <hi>Colophonia</hi> ⅙ part, Arſnick ⅛ part, mix them very well together, and try them in the top of a Braſs Candleſtick, when the fire doth burn furiouſly with a blew and greeniſh colour, then fill the Canvas, and roul it over, being firſt armed with ſtrong twine all over, with this liquid mixture molten in a pan, Pitch four parts, Linſeed Oyl 1 part, Turpentine ⅓ part, Sulphur 1 part, Tarr ⅓ part, Tallow one part; and as ſoon as this is cold, bore two holes in each of the ſame next the Iron an inch deep, with a ſharp Iron Bodkin, filling the ſame with fine bruiſed powder, and putting in every hole a little ſtick of two inches long, which are to be taken out when you would fire the ſame; this compoſition will burn furiouſly.</p>
                     <p>And remember you cut off the ſtaff ſome three inches from the work, and put thereon a braſs ſocket of five or ſix inches long, and then cut the end of your ſtaff to fill the ſocket, for when you fire your work, you may ſtick it in the ſide of a ſhip, and pull the ſtaff out again, ſo will not the work be ſo eaſily avoided, as when the ſtaff was on, and hangs at length, becauſe the very weight of the ſtaff, and length there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will be a means to weigh down the work, or that the enemie may come, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pull it out, or beat it off quickly; let the Compoſition and work contain in weight about 7 pounds, then will it do execution, and work a better effect, than if it were of leſs weight, by much, by reaſon the compoſition elſe would be waſted, before it comes to effect its Execution.</p>
                     <p>To burn the ſayls of Ships a pretty diſtance, or to fire Thatch'd houſes, Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacks, or any other combuſtible matter apt to burn, when you cannot come to the ſame; it is good to have certain ſtrong Croſs-bows to bend with Racks or Gaffels, and ſo ſhoot Arrows armed at the heads with Wild-fire, made of the compoſition as above, and about three inches in length, and one inch and a half in the Diameter, tapred as afore in all points: or you may have long bows, but then let your Arrows be alſo longer, which for divers ſervices may do great good.</p>

If it be three quarters of an inch in thickneſs, the length will be three inches. Roul your Paper hard on the Rouler until the thickneſs be one inch and a quarter Rouler and all; then glue the uppermoſt paper, and the Caſe is made. On the choaking or contracting the paper together at one end, within one Diameter of the end, except only a little hole, about one quarter the Diameter of the bore thereof, to contract theſe Caſes on this manner, do thus, wet the end about one inch in water, then put the Rouler in again, and tye a great packthread about the wet within three quarters of an inch of the end, put another thing almoſt of the ſame Diameter with the Rouler in at the wet end about half an inch, hold it there, get ſome

                     <p>SEt your Rockets mouth upon the edge of any peece of timber, battlement of a wall, top of the Gunners carriage wheel, or any dry place whatſoever, where the rod or twig may hang perpendicular from it, then lay a train of powder that may come under the mouth thereof, give fire thereunto, and you have done. But if you would fire more Rockets than one, that as one deſcendeth, the other may aſcend by degrees, make this compoſition following of <hi>Roch peter</hi> 8 ounces, <hi>Quick Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> 4 ounces, and fine Powder duſt 2 ounces, which lay in a line from one Rocket to another, they being placed ten inches or a foot one from another, give fire to this compoſition, and it will work your deſire, by cauſing one to mount into the air when the other is ſpent; but before you place your Rockets, remember to prick them with the bodkin.</p>

                     <p>You may alſo make them after this manner, you muſt have a rouler which muſt be as big as an ordinary arrow, which ſhall be to roul a length of paper about it, and with a little glue paſt it round; when it is dry draw out the rouler, and fill it by little and little, with a thimble; ſtill thruſting it down, every filling of a thimble, with the rouler; which being filled, cut it in ſhort pieces, about half an inch long; then having in readineſs either hot glue, or ſize, mingled with red lead, dip therein one end of your ſhort peeces, leſt they take fire at both ends together, and becauſe that it may not ſo eaſily blow out: theſe being thus finiſhed, ſet them to dry until you have occaſion to uſe them: and then putting the open end in powder on the top of the Rocket, in that place after the firſt paſtboard, or cover, is placed in a Rocket; next the compoſition, where I taught you before to put powder for to make a report:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42528:221"/> which now you muſt leave out to place in theſe Stars; after this manner make two or three holes in that paſtboard, which prime with powder-duſt: and thereupon put a little Piſtol powder, to blow the Stars out when the Rocket is ſpent: after the powder, put as I have ſaid before, the open ends of theſe Stars, down upon that powder: when you have put them ſo cloſe as they can ſtick one by the other, put a little ſmall corned powder on the top of them, to run between them, and put another tyre of Stars upon that, and in like manner a third tyre upon them, till you come to the top of the Rocket-caſe, there put a paper over the head of it, and tye it cloſe about the top, that none of the powder come from under or between the Stars.</p>

                     <p>I Have taught you to make a report upon the head of a Rocket, and alſo to place golden or ſilver Hair or Rain, or Stars, or Fiſgigs, which when you have divers Rockets to make for a great Fire-work, let one be with a report, the next with Stars, another with Gold Hair, or Rain, one with Silver Hair or Rain, for ſtanding juſt under the Rocket it appeareth like Rain, but being aſide hand, like Golden or Silver Hair: and upon the head of another Rocket place the Fiſgigs, which when the Rocket is ſpent will firſt appear like ſo many Stars, after they are ended, they will ſhew like Serpents wrigling to and fro, and laſtly, give every one his report.</p>
                     <p>It is a rare thing to repreſent a Tree or Fountain, in the air, which is made by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many little Rockets upon one great one, paſſing all the rods of the little ones
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42528:222"/> thorow wires, made on purpoſe upon the ſides of the great one, or ſome other way, as your induſtry will diſcover; now if the little ones take fire while the great one is mounting up, they will repreſent a Tree, but if they take fire as the great one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending or turning down again towards the ground, then they will be like a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of fire; if there be two or three little Rockets amongſt others, that have no rods, they will make divers motions contrary to the reſt, very pleaſing.</p>
                     <p>If before you put the Fiſgigs upon the head of a great Rocket, you with a ſmall ſtring tye them together, a foot of line between; when they are on fire in the Air you will ſee very great variety of Figures, becauſe as they wriggle to and fro, they will pull one another after them, to the ſpeculators great content: it will be pleaſant if you tye them not altogether, but three or four, which will in the firing of them, be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, with great variety.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt and moſt notable defect which is obſerved in Fuzees, is that after they are lighted or riſen into the Air the height of 1, 2, or 3 Perches, they break, and do diſſipate without making their entire effects.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, which is little better, is after it is remaining ſuſpended upon the nail it conſumes but very leiſurely, without going away or raiſing it ſelf in the Air.</p>
                     <p>The third is, when they are raiſed in the Air, they deſcribe only an Arch of a Circle like a Rainbow, and return upon the earth again before the Compoſition in the Fuzee be conſumed.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42528:222"/>
                     <p>The fourth is when it moves in a ſpiral manner, whirling in the Air without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving an equal motion; that is not right as it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is when it mounts ſloathfully and negligently, as if it diſdained or refuſed to elevate it ſelf into the Air.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth and laſt is, that the Caſe or Cartouch remains hanging upon the Nail quite empty, and the Compoſition doth riſe and diſſipate alone into the Air. There is many other vexations and inconveniencies which may give trouble to the Practitioners in theſe Arts with vain expence, which would looſe too much time to repeat: It will be ſufficient if you take notice of theſe which are principal, whereby, if by ill fortune you be faln into any of theſe defaults, you may correct your error eaſily, and then immediately correct thoſe faults. And for this purpoſe, obſerve the rules given in the next Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Infallible Rules by which you may make Fuzees, or Rockets, without any default.</head>
                     <p>FIrſt, that they have their height proportionable to the Diameter of their Orifice, as we have before declared.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Cartouch ought to be of wood, or glued or paſted paper, not too thick, nor too thin.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they ought to be made of ſtrong paper of indifferent dryneſs, properly rouled and well compacted cloſe upon the Former.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the necks ought to be bound about very ſtrongly and firm, in ſuch a ſort, that the knot of the thred, and the folds of the Cartouch, may not lye amiſs one upon the other.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, all the Materials of the Compoſition muſt be exactly weighed according to the proportion of the Orifice of the Fuzee that you would charge, and alſo well beaten and ſifted particularly; after, having weighed them again, and mixed them in one body well together, you muſt pound them again, and paſs them through the Sieve as you did before.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, that the Salt-Peter and Sulphur be powdered and clarified as much as poſſible may be, and the Coal perfectly well burned and exempted from all humidity, and made of wood that is light and ſoft, as the Teile, the Hazle, and the branches of the Willow Tree; and on the contrary, 'tis neceſſary to have a care, that you make not uſe of ſuch Coals as are made of Birch, Oak, nor Maple, becauſe they contain in them much weighty and terreſtial matter.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, matters for Rockets or Fuzees ought to be prepared immediately before they are intended for uſe, and not before.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, the matters of Compoſition ought to be neither too dry nor too moiſt; but moiſtned a little with ſome Oliganious matter, or with a little Brandy wine.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, there muſt be put into the Cartouch alwayes an equal quantity of the Compoſition at a time, and ſo beat it down alike; and thus do until it be filled.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, you muſt beat the Compoſition alwayes with the Rammer right up, or perpendicularly, and take care that in the beating it be not made crooked.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, You muſt ſtrike down the Compoſition with a wooden Mallet, that is of heft proportionable to the bigneſs and thickneſs of the Rocket, and alwayes with an equal ſtrength, and juſt number of ſtroaks, every time you put in any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42528:223"/>
                     <p>Twelfthly, in Cartouches made of paper, you muſt put in round peeces of wood hollowed; but in thoſe that are made of wood, you muſt put ſuch as are ſmooth, without any channel or hollowing, to the end that it joyn the better to the ſides of the Fuzee, where it muſt joyn firmly, as well without as within.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Fuzee muſt be peirced with a Bit or Awl that is convenient, in ſuch a ſort that the hole be not too big nor too ſtraight, nor too long nor too ſhort.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The hole muſt be made the moſt ſtreight and perpendicular that may be poſſible, and juſt in the middle of the Compoſition, to the end that it lean not to any one ſide, more than to the other.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Fuzee muſt not be peirced before it be intended for uſe, and after it is pierced you muſt handle it tenderly, only with the ends of your fingers, for fear of deforming it.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Pearch or Stick to which you faſten the Fuzee, ought to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as well in length as weight; it muſt not be crooked nor winding in any manner, neither unequal, nor full of knots, but ſtreight as poſſible can be made, and muſt therefore be made ſmooth, and ſtreightned with a Plain, if need requires.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. After they are Charged, they muſt not be laid into too dry a place, nor in a place too moiſt, for the one or other of thoſe accidents may hurt them; therefore let the place be temperate.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. When you would uſe them and put them into action, hang them upon a nail perpendicular to the Horizon.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. You muſt not think to raiſe a bundle of a great weight, or that has too great a diſproportion to their ſtrength, you muſt adjoyn them together ſo rightly, that all together may have a proper form, and reaſonable to paſs into the Air, and to elevate it ſelf on high without any difficulty, and in ſuch a ſort, that thoſe bundles may not by any means give hinderance or ſtoppage to their riſing in a ſtreight line; and take care moſt exactly that the Fuzee be not ſo big, but that they may retain as near as you can a Pyramidal or Conical form, when all its weight that may be is adjoyned to it.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Men ought to ſhun as much as poſſible thoſe nights that are rainy, moiſt, and when the Sky is darkned with black clouds, as being very incommodious and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the Fuzees. And more than that, avoid impetuous Stormy winds, and the Whirl-winds hinder no leſs than the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. You may not reject above other cauſes, the different effects which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſundry Fuzees (although they be charged with one and the ſame Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) no otherwiſe than thus, that they were not made with an equal diligence either in the Charging or Peircing, or in the other Circumſtances, which you were obliged to obſerve; or in this, that it may be ſome may have been kept in a more moiſter place than the others, where they have acquired too much moiſture, which cauſeth to them, effects much different one from another, as well in Riſing as in Conſuming.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. If you would make appear in the Air ſtreams of fire, or a quantity of burning ſparks or ſtars, or long large rayes to dart from the Fuzees; there is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to mix with the Compoſition ſome ſmall quantity of powdered Glaſs groſly beaten, filings of Iron, Sawduſt. One may alſo repreſent fire of divers colours, as we have ſhewed before in the fifth Chapter; but more particularly thus; if you put a certain portion of Camphire in your Compoſition, you will ſee in the Air a certain fire which will appear, white, pale, and of the colour of Milk; if you put Greek Pitch, which is a light yellow Pitch uſed in Plaiſters, called <hi>Pix Burgundy,</hi> it will repreſent unto you a red flame, and of the colour of Braſs; if you put in Sulphur, the fire will appear blew; if Sal-Armoniack, the fire will appear Greeniſh; if from Crude Antimony, the flame will be Red, Yellowiſh, and of the Colour of Honey; if the filings of Ivory be added, they will render a Silver-like, White and ſhining flame, yet ſomething inclining to a Livid Plumbous colour; if the powder of Yellow Amber be added, the fire will appear of the ſame colour, with the Citrine; laſtly, if black Pitch be added, it will throw forth an obſcure ſmoaky fire, or rather a ſmoak that is black and thick, which will darken all the Air.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Compoſitions to Charge Globes or Balls, that will burn as well under as above water.</head>
                     <p>FIrſt, take Salt-Peter reduced into fine meal 16 <hi>l.</hi> Sulphur 4 <hi>l.</hi> of the ſawings of wood which hath been firſt boyled in a Nitrous water, and afterwards well dryed, 4 <hi>l.</hi> Of good Corned powder half a pound, of the powder of Ivory 4 ounces. Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Salt-Peter 6 <hi>l.</hi> Sulphur 3 <hi>l.</hi> of beaten powder 1 <hi>l.</hi> Filings of Iron 2 <hi>l.</hi> of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy pitch half a pound. Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Salt-Peter 24 <hi>l.</hi> of beaten powder 4 l. Sulphur 12 <hi>l.</hi> of Sawduſt 8 <hi>l.</hi> of yellow Amber half a pound, of Glaſs beaten in groſs powder half a pound, of Camphire half a pound. For that which concerns the manner of preparing all theſe Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it differs nothing from what we have preſcribed in the making of Rockets, only 'tis not neceſſary that the materials be ſo ſubtilly beaten, powdered nor ſifted, as for thoſe <hi>Fuzees,</hi> but nevertheleſs to be well mixed one among another. Care muſt be taken that they be not too dry when you charge the Globes or Balls, and for that purpoſe they may be moiſtned with Linſeed-oyl, Oyl of Olives, Petrole, Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Nuts, or any other fatty humour that is receptible of fire.</p>
                     <p>Note, that amongſt all theſe Compoſitions of matters that will burn in the water, which I have here propoſed from my own particular experience, every one may make them as pleaſeth himſelf beſt, provided he always take the materials in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42528:224"/> one to the other, as they ought. But nevertheleſs I ſhall counſel you to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience from time to time your Compoſitions, for the greater ſurety, before you expoſe them to the publick view of the world. It is alſo amongſt the reſt very neceſſary that you learn the force and ſtrength of every material you put into the Compoſitions, whereby you may at your pleaſure know how to alter and vary your proportion, as you ſhall judg fit.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of Stars and fiery Sparks, called by the <hi>Germans Stern-veuer</hi> and <hi>Veuerputzen.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Have ſhewed the Compoſition of Stars in Chap. 5. I have alſo ſhewed the way of making them up, and their uſe, and alſo I have ſhewed the manner of giving to them various Colours, as in the 22 Rule of the 13 Chapter, where I had an intent to ſay no more of theſe things: But finding in Maſter <hi>Cazimier</hi>'s Artillery theſe Compoſitions, which I judge may prove very excellent; therefore I thought good to inſert them, that I might leave out nothing that might make more perfect any thing we treat of.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you muſt know that between fiery Sparks and Stars there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the Stars are greater, and are not ſo ſoon conſumed by the fire as the Sparks are, but do ſubſiſt longer in the Air, and do ſhine with greater ſubſtance, and with ſuch a light, that by reaſon of their great ſplendor, they are in ſome manner comparable with the Stars in the Heavens. They are prepared according to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Method.</p>
                     <p>Take Salt-Peter half a pound, Sulphur two ounces, Yellow Amber powdered one Dram, Antimony Crude one Dram, of beaten Powder three Drams. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Sulphur two ounces and a half, Salt-Peter four ounces, Powder ſubtilly powdered four ounces, Olibanum, Maſtick, Chriſtal, Mercury ſublimate, of each four ounces, White Amber one ounce, Camphire one ounce, Antimony and Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment half an ounce; All theſe materials being well beaten and well ſifted, they muſt be mixt together with a little Glue or Gum-water, made with Gum-Arabick or Tragacant; then make them into ſmall Balls about the bigneſs of a Bean or ſmall Nut, which being dryed in the Sun, or in a Pan by the fire, may be kept in a convenient place for ſuch uſes as we have ſpoken of in the fifth Chapter of this Book. You muſt only remember, that when you would put them into Rockets or Recreative Balls, they muſt be covered on all ſides with prepared Tow, of which we have ſhewed the way of preparing in the ſeventh Chapter of the firſt Part of our Fire-works.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Fire-Maſters are aecuſtomed to take in the places of theſe little Balls, a certain proportion of melted matters, of which we have ſpoken in the firſt Part of Fire-works; But if theſe do not pleaſe you, by reaſon of their ſwarthy colour, but you rather deſire to ſee them yellow, or inclining ſomewhat to white, then take of Gum-Arabick or Tragacant four ounces, powder it and paſs it through a Sieve, of Camphire diſſolved in <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> two ounces, Salt-Peter a pound and a half, Sulphur half a pound, Glaſs groſly powdered four ounces, White Amber an ounce and a half, Orpiment two ounces, make all theſe Ingredients into one maſs, and make Globes of them as before. I Learned this, ſaith my Author, from <hi>Claude Midorge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42528:224"/>
                     <p>For the method of making Sparkles in particular, it is thus; Take Salt-Peter one ounce, of this Liquid matter half an ounce, of beaten Powder half an ounce, of Camphire two ounces; after you have beaten all theſe materials into powder, every one by it ſelf, put all of them into an Earthen Pan, and put upon them the Water of Gum Tragacanth, or Brandy-wine, wherein you have diſſolved ſome Gum Tragacanth or Arabick, until it be of a good conſiſtency; that done, take an ounce of Lint, which has firſt been boyled in Brandy-wine or Vinegar, or in Salt-Peter, and after dryed again, and the threads drawn out; then put it into the Compoſition, and mix them well together, ſo well and ſo long until it has drank up all the matter; of theſe Compoſitions make little Balls in the form of Pills, and of the bigneſs of great Peas, which you muſt roul in mealed Gun-powder, and dry them, whereof you may ſerve your ſelf, according to the method we have preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, there are certain odoriferous Pills prepared, which are employed in ſmall Engines and fiery Inventions, which are ſhewed in Chamber Roams, or cloſe Cabinets, theſe are commonly prepared of Storax, Calamite, Benjamin, Amber, white and yellow, and of Camphire, of each one ounce, Salt-Peter three ounces, of Coals made of the Teil Tree four ounces; beat all theſe Ingredients to powder, then incorporate them well together, and moiſten them with Roſe Water, in which is diſſolved Gum-Arabick or Tragacanth, to make thereof little Balls; at laſt, having faſhioned them, expoſe them to the Sun or to the fire to dry.</p>

                     <p>Again, I ſay, that this <hi>Parabola</hi> is deſcribed by the <hi>Impetus</hi> given, for A E, E F, and E B, or thoſe three lines equal to D G the Altitude, G F the Semi-baſe, and G L are in continual proportion.

                     <p>Then thus: the <hi>Impetus</hi> of the <hi>Parabola</hi> A G in the point A, is as much as that of the Cadent naturally falling from L to D, (by X. of <hi>Galilaeus</hi>) that is, from B to A, or of the Project aſcending from A to B: therefore the <hi>Parabola</hi> hath in the point A the <hi>Impetus</hi> that was given: wherefore that is done which was required.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Propoſition is of great moment, for clearing of thoſe that follow, we will prove it another way.</p>

                     </figure>
                     <p>Firſt, it is manifeſt that the point P cannot be in the line L D; becauſe ſince the line A C toucheth each <hi>Parabola,</hi> that I D the common <hi>Axis</hi> ſhould be cut into two equal parts in two points by the Vertex's of the <hi>Parabola,</hi> is abſurd.

                     <p>Now let the point P fall any where at pleaſure, and draw the Horizontal line P R S: for as much as P N and P M are equal, by the II of<note n="*" place="margin">Which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime point of the Range of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>[P]</hi> doth cut the Perpendicular <hi>[M]</hi> intercepted betwixt the Horizon and line of direction, into two equal parts.</note> this, N R and R A, P R and R S ſhall be equal. And becauſe the <hi>Parabola</hi> A P hath the <hi>Impetus</hi> B A; that is, O M, the Point O ſhall be its ſublimity: and for that reaſon the lines O P, P R, and P M ſhall be in continual proportion; and the Rectangle O P M equal unto the ſquare P R: and changing the lines with their equals, the Rectangle B S A ſhall be equal to the ſquare S R: therefore the R is in the point Periphery of the Semicircle: which is abſurd; for the right line A F ſhall meet with the Periphery in two ſeveral points: wherefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. In the Book of <hi>Galilaeus de motu naturaliter accelerato,</hi> it is proved, that projects thrown with the ſame <hi>Impetus</hi> out of A, if born up by plains of ſeveral incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, do alwayes arrive unto one and the ſame Horizontal plain. But here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the ſeveral aſcenſions of projects do vary when they are thrown thorough the pure Air, without any fulciment put under them, according to ſeveral elevations. For the moveable ſhall leſs aſcend, which is emitted along the line A B leſs elevated, than that which ſhall be projected along A D more elevated.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is manifeſt alſo, that no Altitude can in ſuch ſort aſcend, as that it may reach unto the Horizontal parallel that is drawn thorow E the higheſt point of the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular projection.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is alſo manifeſt, that all Amplitudes do alwayes encreaſe from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which is called the point blanck Randon, until you come to the projection made at the Semi-right Angle. And from the Semi-right unto the perpendicular, they alwayes diminiſh until they come to nothing; which hapneth in the perpendicular projection, which hath no Amplitude.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. It is manifeſt likewiſe that the Altitudes and Sublimities of projections equi-diſtant from the Semi-right, are reciprocally equal to one another, that is, the Altitude of the one is equal to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of the other.</p>

                     <p>I know that its very ſeldom, and perhaps neverfound, that the greateſt Range of a Piece of Ordnance is juſt thoſe 4000 Paces, as it ſeemeth to have been ſuppoſed in the Calculating of our Table, and alſo in thoſe of <hi>Signiore Galileo,</hi> ſo that the ſaid Table might ſeem unuſeful: but we ſhall ſhew, that the ſuppoſed number of 4000 doth not therefore ſerve to any great particular Machine, to the end it might ſerve to all in general. It is neceſſary therefore to take notice, that that ſame ſuppoſitious Number of 4000, is not of Paces, or of Ells, or of Yards, or of any other determinate meaſure, but of abſtracted parts, ſuch yet, whatever they are, as being convertible into any kinds of poſſible meaſures, they do make the Table general, as well for the Culvering, as for the Mortar-Piece or Croſs-Bow. And to give an example how it may be adapted and applyed to all the Species of Artillery, and how the Abſtract parts may be reduced into Geometrical paces, we will do thus.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Range of a Canon, by experiment made thereof, is found to be, ſuppoſe 2300 paces; and I would with the ſame Piece make a ſhot that ſhould be 860 paces, I do thus: If the greateſt Range 2300 give 860, I ask what the number 1000, the greateſt of the Table will give? I work and find 374: which number being ſought in the Table, is found to be betwixt 370 and 380. Therefore taking the part proportional according to my Judgement, I find the Arch of its Elevation ought to be <hi>Grad.</hi> 11. very near, or its Complement <hi>gr.</hi> 79. And thus it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42528:231"/> that that ſame Piece which being mounted to ſix points did carry 2300 paces, being elevated <hi>gr.</hi> 11. or 79. of the Quadrant, ſhall carry 860 paces, as we did deſire.</p>

                        <p>The Angle of Elevation CAB <hi>gr.</hi> 30, being given, the right Angled Triangle EAC ſhall be given in Specie: and becauſe AB is given in paces, AE ſhall be given, which is the fourth part thereof, namely 600 paces. Let us therefore, to find the quantity of AD, work in this manner by Calculations and Sines.</p>
                        <p>Say, if as the Right Sine 86602 of the Angle ACE, <hi>gr.</hi> 60. that is, of the Complement of the Elevation, is to the ſide AE, which is 600: ſo is the whole Sine 100000 to a fourth number 693: and thus the Hypothenuſe AC ſhall be 693 Paces. But becauſe that the right angled Triangle ACD is given in Specie, begin again and ſay, as the right Sine 50000 of the angle ADC, which is equal to the angle given of the Elevation EAC, is to the right Line AC, which is found to be 693 paces, ſo is the whole line to a fourth number 1386. And thus the right line ſought AD, ſhall be 1386 paces. But becauſe AD, being the line of <hi>Impetus</hi> or Sublimity, is equal to half the greateſt Range; if we double 1386, we ſhall make the number of 2772 paces; for ſo much ſhall be the length of the deſired greateſt Range of that Gun, which being elevated to the Randon of <hi>gr.</hi> 30, is found to carry 2400 paces.</p>
                        <p>But with much more brevity, and at one ſingle working, we may perform the ſame thus. Suppoſe the whole Sine to be CF, then FA and FD ſhall be the Tangents, one, of the angle of elevation, and the other of its Complement. Say, therefore, as the whole Sine is to CF, which is 600: ſo is 230940 (which is the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42528:232"/> ſum of both thoſe Tangents) to a fourth number 1386. And thus the right line AD is found, as before, 1386 paces: which being doubled, will give the meaſure of <hi>e</hi> the Semirect, or greateſt<note place="margin">Or the beſt of the Randon.</note> Randon, as you well call it.</p>

                        <p>It ſhall ſuffice to have hinted this little for the Calculating of ſome varieties that may happen about theſe Ranges. Other caſes may be put, like to theſe, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of their converſions; but from the knowledge of theſe, thoſe may eaſily be deducted: and the Ingenuity of any Geometrician, applying himſelf thereto, ſhall find leſs difficulty in reſolving many of theſe Problems of himſelf, than in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the length and obſcurity of our explanations. Therefore we will proceed to the making of the Quadrant, the which ſeemeth really appropriated, nay, made by Nature on purpoſe for to meaſure Scientifically and Geometrically the Ranges of Projects.</p>

                        <head>Of the Quadrant.</head>
                        <p>LEt us now come to practice; and by help of an Inſtrument, let us reſolve ſome of the Propoſitions above demonſtrated. We will make a Military Quadrant, which with invariable certainty ſheweth (at leaſt to Geometrical Philoſophers, if not to practical Gunners) what Mounture or Elevation ought to be given to any Piece, to the end that the length of the Range may prove to be of ſuch a certain meaſure. We will alſo reſolve, by help hereof, all Problems that can be framed about the ſhooting of Artillery, which were heretofore promiſed by <hi>Tartaglia,</hi> and reduced into Tables by <hi>Galileo,</hi> with ſomething over and above. Military Induſtry did find that the uſe of a Machine ſo noble, and of ſo great conſequence as the Canon, would be too much confined, and of too little benefit, if it could not be made uſe of ſave only at that ſmall diſtance to which it carrieth a point blank, or in its level Range, without giving it with the Quadrant the advantageous aſſiſtance of ſome elevation. It was therefore enquired how a man might do that with the ſame Piece, which of it ſelf did not carry more than 200 or 250 Geometrical paces, he might ſhoot 400 and alſo 600 paces, and more and more, until he come to the length of the greateſt Range that can be made by that Piece. The Invention was thus: They began to help the Piece by Elevation, that is, they directed it not ſtraight upon th' object which it was to hit, but, holding it in the very vertical of th' object, they elevated it above that right line which goeth from the Piece unto the object: and this they did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and ſometimes leſs, according as the force of the Shot was to be greater or leſſer: An Artifice that from the very beginning of the world hath been known even to artleſs Boyes. We ſee that when they with a Ball of Snow, or other matter, do aim to hit a mark that is very near, they throw it directly at the mark: but being at another time to aim at one which ſtandeth farther off, or being to throw Stones at each other, they do not throw Horizontally, or directly at their Adverſaries, but turning the caſt half way into the Air, without having ever had any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they do all throw at the elevation of the fifth, and alſo of the ſixth point of the Military Square to them unknown: But Gunners, in proceſs of time, have found an Inſtrument, that doth with facility meaſure theſe Elevations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nicolo Tartaglia</hi> of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> a famous Mathematician, did invent a Square with unequal ſides joyned together with the Quadrant, which hath for more than a hundred years paſt, been generally uſed, and is ſtill the only Regulator of Gunners, not only to manage great Guns, and to raiſe them to thoſe Mountures which they call Randons, but alſo to level them in the Point-blank Ranges; <hi>Tartaglia</hi> divided that Quadrant into 12 equal parts, beginning the Numeration of them from the leſſer [or ſhorter] ſide; he alſo ſubdivided each of thoſe into other 12 equal parts, naming thoſe firſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42528:235"/> Points, and theſe ſecond Minutes of the Quadrant. We will inſert the figure of the Quadrant, and ſhew how it meaſureth the Elevation [Mounture or Randon] of the Piece.</p>
                        <figure>
                           <figDesc>elevation measurement</figDesc>
                        </figure>
                        <p>By the help of this Quadrant Gunners have with long obſervations compoſed ſuch a <hi>Praxis,</hi> as that they know how many points they are to mount <hi>v. gr.</hi> a Culvering of 40 pound Ball to hit a mark diſtant; for example, 700 Geometrical paces, or at any other diſtance.</p>
                        <p>But the truth is, the obſervations are ſo fallible, and the Gunners ſo few that have made them, and made them exactly, that the uſe of Artillery, taking from it the Range of Point Blank, muſt needs have very little of certainty in it.</p>
                        <p>If one would collect ſome certain Science touching th' ordinary Quadrant, it would be neceſſary to make the Experiments not only with all ſorts of Balls, and with all the varieties of Powder, but in all kind of Pieces, as alſo in all thoſe that being the ſame <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> are of different grandeur; and laſtly, at all poſſible degrees of Elevation. A Multiplication that almoſt runs up into infinity. And we obſerve that theſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments ought to be all made one by one; for it is not true, that by way of proportion one may from three or four Ranges of a Canon made at ſeveral elevations, argue to any others, no not of the ſame Canon, laden with the ſame Powder and Ball. That this is ſo, may be demonſtrated by help of the Tables made by <hi>Signiore Galilaeo,</hi> and by us. For example, That Canon which being elevated at the ſixth Point, curryeth its ſhot 4000 paces, elevated at one Point, ought to curry the ſixth part, at two points the third, and at three points the half of that Range. But the thing falls out far otherwiſe: For being elevated to one point, it curryeth 1032 inſtead of 666, which is the ſixth part of that ſame greateſt Range 4000: at the ſecond point (and note that with this Mounture, Pieces carry alwayes the half of the greateſt Range) in our caſe will curry 2000 in ſtead of 1333, which is the third part: At the third point it will curry 2824, inſtead of 2000, which is the half of the greateſt Range: at the fourth point it will curry 3464 inſtead of 2666: At the fifth point it will curry 3860, in ſtead of 2333, which are 5 ſixths of that greateſt Range: See therefore how that increaſing equally the Mountures of the Piece, that is ſhooting firſt at one point only, then at two, three, four, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto the ſixth, the increaſes of the lengths of the Ranges do not increaſe equally, that is with the ſame proportion wherewith the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42528:235"/>
                           <note place="margin">Or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>Randons increaſe. But the firſt point currying 1032, the ſecond increaſeth above it 968, the third increaſeth 824, the fourth 640, the fifth 396, the ſixth 140. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to derive ſome rule from the Experiments, it were neceſſary to make them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, at all the Grades of Randons, in all ſorts of Pieces, with all varieties of Powders, and different matters of Balls; and happily one might ſay, it were neceſſary alſo that every Gunner made them by himſelf. Things almoſt impoſſible to reduce unto Rules, from which any certainty might be gathered, if the Theorick and Geometry had not given us a manifeſt Science thereof, by means of that one ſole Propoſition of <hi>Galileo,</hi> in which firſt of all men he hath advertiſed and taught us, <hi>That Pro ects do all move in a Parabolical Line.</hi> Upon this ſuppoſition we will ground the Inſtrument promiſed: and though by the impediment of the <hi>medium</hi> the <hi>Parabola's</hi> become too deformed, or by many other accidents the Ranges prove very inconſtant, yet it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us to have given indubitable ſatisfaction to the School of Mathematicians, if not to that of Gunners.</p>
                        <p>Before we ſet down the making of our ſquare, which conſiſteth only in deſcribing one ſingle Semi-circle, we will divide the ordinary Quadrant into unequal points, ſo as they may not meaſure the Randons of the Piece, but the lengths of the Ranges, which is that that ſerves to our purpoſe. Thus we ſhall be aſſured, that the Gun, if it ſhall be elevated to one point of the ſaid Quadrant, ſhall carry to ſuch a diſtance, whatever it be: and elevated to two points, ſhall preciſely double that Range: and if to three, it ſhall carry three of thoſe ſpaces; if to four and a half, it ſhall carry four and a half; if to five and a quarter, it ſhall carry five and a quarter; and thus until you come to the ſixth point, ſhall the points of the Quadrant in the Inſtrument, and the ſpaces of the Ranges in the Field, alwayes increaſe in the ſame manner, and with the ſame proportion, and from the ſixth to the twelfth point, they ſhall go in the ſame manner decreaſing. The conſtruction and demonſtration is Geometrically taken from the propoſition which we have made the Firſt of this our Book of Projects, which by the Amplitude given, teacheth us to find the Elevation. And it ſerveth in common for whatſoever ſort of Artillery and Mortar Pieces, and for any ſort of Ball or Powder.</p>

                        <p>Now it is manifeſt by our I. Propoſition, that if the line of the<note place="margin">Of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> direction, or of the elevation of the Piece ſhall be AO, or AP, the Amplitude or length of the Range ſhall be as the Quadruple of the SO; and if the direction ſhall be AM, or AN, the Range ſhall be as the Quadruple of RM: and if the elevation were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the line AFD, the Range ſhall be as the Quadruple of QF: but the lines SO, RM, and QF, by our conſtruction do equally exceed: And, therefore, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Quadruples, or the Ranges aforeſaid, ſhall equally exceed one the other.</p>

                           <head>The uſe of the aforementioned Diviſion made in the ordinary Quadrant.</head>
                           <p>LEt there be propounded any Piece of Artillery, or Mortar-Piece; and with it let there be one ſingle Experiment made, that is, let it be elevated to any point, as for example to the fifth. Let it off, and meaſure the length of the Range, and let it be found, <hi>verbi gratia,</hi> to be 2000 parts; this done we may know how far the ſame Piece will carry, being charged in the ſame manner, and elevated to any what-ever other Point or Minute: which ſhall be eaſie by the Rule of three, the points in this Inſtrument, as well as the length of the Ranges, being proportional. The <hi>Praxis</hi> is this; I deſire to know how far the ſixth point carrieth, I thus ſay, If five points give 2000 paces, how much ſhall ſix points give? and I find 2400 paces. I ſay then that the ſhot of that Piece at the ſixth point, that is at the greateſt Range, will curry 2400 of thoſe parts, at which of the fifth point it curried 2000.</p>
                           <p>And take notice by the way, that inſtead of performing this operation with the points 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, It may be done with their Complements, which are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.</p>
                           <p>But if it were required (which importeth much more) that we ſhould elevate the aforeſaid Piece in ſuch ſort, that the length of the Range ought to be; for example, 1300 paces, we are to work thus. If 2000 paces were made by 5 points, or to ſay better, by 60 Minutes of the Quadrant, by how many points ſhall 1300 paces be made? the working will be 2000. 60. 1300. 39, and we ſhall find that for to make the Range of 1300 paces, it would be neceſſary to give the Piece the Mounture of 39 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the Quadrant, or of three points and a quarter.</p>

                           <p>BUt if we would frame an Inſtrument, which ſhall not only meaſure the length of the Ranges made at ſeveral Randons, but alſo the Altitude of the <hi>Parabola,</hi> the duration or time of the flight [or Range] the ſublimity, and the other things demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the aforeſaid Book of Projects, all this ſhall be performed with the ſole and ſimple Semi-circle of I. Propoſition. But let us proceed to the making of it.</p>
                           <figure>
                              <figDesc>semi-circle and square</figDesc>

                           </figure>
                           <p>That this is ſo, ſhall thus be demonſtrated (having reference to the I. Propoſition of Projects, and its Corollaries.) Let the line of the direction ABI be prolonged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, as alſo the perpendicular FBL; then by imagination take BL of ſuch a length, that it may be really equal to half the greateſt Range of our preſent Piece. And about the Diameter BL, let there be imaginarily drawn the great Semi-circle BIL; cutting the Circumference BI in any point I; and draw the Horizontal line IM. It is manifeſt, by the afore-cited Propoſ. I. of Projects, that the line MI ſhall be the real fourth part of the length of the Range; as alſo, that DM ſhall be the (not imiginary, but) real Altitude of the ſaid Range; and ſo the other meaſures in the Semi-circle BIL, ſhall be all true and real. Now obſerve, that the Triangle HBF is like to the Triangle BIM, as being right-angled, and having two angles at the Point B. Therefore the ſame Propoſition ſhall be between all the ſmall and imaginary meaſures of the ſquare AC, as is between all the true meaſures in the imaginary and great Semi-circle BIL; that is, the lines, AB, BF, FH and HB, ſhall be to one another in the ſame proportion reſpectively as LB, BIIM, and M B. Therefore, as to arguing in the proportions, we may without any error, as well make uſe of thoſe feigned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions upon the ſquare, as of the true ones, imagined in the Amplitude of the Air.</p>
                           <p>It remains now that we ſhew how this Doctrine, which hath hitherto been a meer Speculation, may now be reduced to Manual practice, and that with facility. Every one ſeeth that for our obtaining knowledge of the quantity of the lines AB, BF, FH, and HB, and their proportions in the precedent Figure, it would be neceſſary that all the aforeſaid lines were divided into moſt Minute parts with ſome common meaſure. To this purpoſe, therefore, we will divide the Diameter AB, and Semi-Diameter ED, into equal and very ſmall parts, as appeareth in the following Figure; (upon which let us deſcribe the imaginary ſquare) and then let us give to each diviſion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42528:237"/> the circumference, its guides parallel to thoſe Diameters, that ſo in them the number and quantity of the lines which ſhall be Indices of the length and Altitudes of the Ranges, may be read or found: And in the point of the angle of Semi-circle B, place the Thread and Plummet.</p>
                           <p>As to the number of parts into which the Diameter AB is to be divided, it ſhall be left to the choice of every one; but yet it will be convenient to make choice of the number 2000, for that it will facilitate the Arithmetical operation.</p>
                           <p>It is to be noted, that if any one will make a ſquare, as hath been ſaid, on purpoſe for one kind of Artillery onely, he ſhall without the leaſt trouble of Calculation, have the meaſures of all its Ranges.</p>
                           <p>The Diviſion of this ſquare is to be made <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> in this manner. Make an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the greateſt Range of that ſame Piece to which you would have the ſquare to be adapted, and let it be found <hi>v. gr.</hi> to be 3000. Then divide the Diameter of the ſquare into 1500 parts, and the perpendicular Semi-diameter into 750 equal parts; that is, imagine that the Diameter AB 1500, is the half of the greateſt Range 3000; as alſo, that the perpendicular Semi-diameter ED 750, is the fourth part of that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Range. And thus, every of the other Elevations being afterwards given, as ſoon as we ſhall apply this Square to the Muzzle of the Piece, we ſhall immediately ſee how many paces is the length, and how many the Altitude of the Range, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this ſquare made <hi>v. gr.</hi> for a Canon of 60 pound Ball, would be alſo good for every other Canon of 60 pound Ball, that ſhould be the ſame in length, and other proportions, with that.</p>
                           <p>It's true indeed, that if we would make the ſquare univerſal, to ſerve indifferently for all Species and Magnitudes of Artillery, we muſt then do thus. Divide the Diameter AB in the precedent figure in 2000 equal parts: alſo let the Semi-Diameter ED be divided into 1000 equal parts, (we by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of the figure have divided it only into 100, taking the parts by ten and ten.) This done, let there be drawn by the Diviſions of the Circumference, cut into equal degrees, as is uſual, the guides parallel unto the Diameters, that ſo one may upon thoſe Diameters read or find the quantity of the right lines, as they ſhall happen to be.</p>

And if we would have the ſublimities, it would be neceſſary to work with GO and GL.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42528:237"/> we are to find what elevation ought to be given to the Piece. Work thus: If the 1250 paces of the previous Experiment give IO numbred, what ſhall the 2200 paces give? and you ſhall find a number, which ſuppoſe for example, to be aſcribed on the ſquare unto the line ML. the Peice Therefore is to be raiſed to ſuch a Randon, that the thread may paſs thorow the point M; and then the Range ſhall be 2200 paces.</p>

Nay, if the Horizontal Motion were ſimple and alone, without any mixture with the perpendicular Motion, what other would the Ball do but run equi-diſtant unto the Wall, without ever touching it, ſo far would it be from breaking it, although it were a very thin Glaſs?

                     <hi>OF THE Swiftneſs OF SOUND.</hi> The ſwiftneſs of Sound is greater than the ſwiftneſs of Bullets ſhot off, and finiſhes <hi>230</hi> fathoms in the ſpace of one ſecond minute.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoever would try the ſwiftneſs of Sounds by night, and by day, either in valleys, woods, or mountains, either with or againſt the wind, or when it is rainy or fair weather, ſhall find in all reſpects as I have tried it, that there will be alwayes the ſame ſwiftneſs of Sound.</p>
                  <p>But after that you have ſearched out a ſecond by 230 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, he that ſhoots off a leſſer Gun, may again retire 230 fathoms, ſo that he may be gone back from you 460 fathoms, the ſame or the like Sound in paſſing over that way will ſpend two ſeconds; which when it ſhall be five times multiplied by us, that we ſhould hear the Sound 1150 fathoms, the flaſh by night breaking forth from the mouth of the Gun is alwayes ſeen at that diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sound is heard five ſeconds of time. And ſeeing we make a <hi>French</hi> league to be 2500 fathoms, and the circuit of the Earth 7200 of ſuch leagues, you may eaſily conclude in what time the ſound does paſs over one whole or ſeveral leagues, for the ſwiftneſs of the ſound is not diminiſhed by its debility, whenas the laſt part of the Sound that may be heard does emulate the ſwiftneſs of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Sound of the Gun therefore will paſs over a league in the ſpace of 11 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, ſeeing a league contains 11 times 230 fathoms (the ſpace paſſed over in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond minute) leſs onely by 30 fathoms, which are here ſcarce worth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe that they are paſſed over by the Sound in the ſeventh part of a ſecond.</p>

                  <p>From which many things may be gathered; firſt, that a Souldier attentive my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or ſhun the ſhot of a Gun at one hundred fathoms, is he foreſaw the flaſh of it; which I thus demonſtrate: It is evident from obſervation, that a Bullet in flying 100 fathoms does at the leaſt ſpend a ſecond of time, and the Sound of it in paſſing of them does at the moſt ſpend but half a ſecond. Therefore the Souldier from the fire ſeen (if Viſion can be in an inſtant) hath a whole ſecond wherein he my eaſily go three or four paces before that the bullet can fly ſo far; alſo there remains to him half a ſecond from that point of time in which he hears the Sound, until the coming of the Bullet: although I would not adviſe any one to try that, unleſs he firſt fortifie himſelf with a ſhield, helmet, and all other kind of Armour, that he may be out of all danger. But any one may try it behind a wall, to which the Sound will come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bullet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the Sound and fire obſerved, may be known how much the Guns are diſtant that are ſhot off againſt the beſieged, or beſiegers, even as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gunners there will not be wanting matter to promote their Art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by hearing the Sound of Thunder, and ſeeing the lightning go before may be known how far it is off, ſo that if the Thunder be not changed from the place where the lightning was ſeen; for how many ſeconds (whether meaſured by the pulſe, which exactly continues a ſecond, or by a Pendulum or any other Watch) there are between the Lightning and the Sound, ſo many 230 fathoms are to be reckoned; ſo that if you number five ſeconds it may be diſtant from you half a league; if ten ſeconds a whole league, whether the diſtance ſhall be upright, or ſide-wayes and oblique, for it matters nothing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If by the turnings and windings or Circles in the air a ſound in the ſame manner may be conſidered, and cauſed, as we ſee circles extended in the water ſtruck with the finger or a little ſtone, as all almoſt believe, and if from the ſwiftneſs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in like manner moved we my gheſs at their craſſitude, thickneſs and weight, we may ſay that water is 1380 times thicker and heavier than air; for as much as the Semidiameter of Circles of the Water in any manner ſtruck, which is made in a ſecond of time, ſcarce exceeds a foot, in which time the ſemidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiter of Circles in the air, made alſo by any percuſſion is 1380 foot, that is 230 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms; which proportion of gravities come very near to obſervations by him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. There is yet one thing that may cauſe ſome doubt, which is, that the Sound of greater Guns moves more ſlowly than of leſſer, whereas our Geometer in the ſiege at <hi>Theodonis</hi> obſerved that their Sound was heard, from the fire ſeen, after thirteen or fourteen ſeconds of time, when yet he was ſcarce half a league diſtant from thoſe Guns; And the Sound according to that which hath been before ſaid, may paſs over a whole league and more in that time: Wherefore the Sound of thoſe Guns doth ſeem to be different from that of leſſer Guns.</p>
                  <p>The Author having by this diſcourſe argued that the Sound of Guns is heard at the diſtance of above 16 miles a minute (which is almoſt as ſwift as the <hi>Copernicans</hi> ſuppoſe the Earth to move in its diurnal revolution about its Axis) it was thought fit to ſubjoyn hereto the Authors latter thoughts of the ſame Argument, publiſhed three years after.</p>

                  <head>OF THE SWIFTNESS OF SOUND, And force of Bullets ſhot out of Guns.</head>
                  <p>WHen I have oftentimes conſidered that the Sound paſſes over 230 fathoms in the time of a 2d or ſixtieth part of a minute; and that there ſeem to ariſe ſomeed doubt, whether there ſhould be that Swiftneſs of the Sound of greater Guns, as there is of leſſer, with which I tried; at length it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that in the ſpace of eleven ſeconds, the Sound of the greater Guns of the Kings Armory, have paſſed from the ſame Armory, after the flaſh was ſeen, as far as our houſe, or the <hi>Vicennian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, whilſt for obtaining the ſurrender of <hi>Pouploon</hi> the Guns were ſhot off by night.</p>
                  <p>But when with a fathom I found that it was 3524 fathoms from Port Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> to the gate of the aforeſaid Convent, where the ear was, and to the wall of the <hi>Vicennian</hi> Caſtle firſt meeting it, near 2500 fathoms, 'tis certain firſt that it is a juſt league of 2500 fathoms from the Garden walk of the Armory, from whence the Guns are wont to be ſhot off, to that Caſtle: for if any thing in the paſſage muſt be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that diſtance will well enough equal it, whereby the corner of the Garden is more diſtant, or the walk by <hi>Sequana</hi> nearer from the Caſtle, than Port Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is evident therefore that the Sound runs over more than 230 Fathoms in each ſecond, to wit, 320 in every ſecond, which make 1920 foot; which ſince any one can prove by his own experiments, I need not ſay more thereof.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may imagine that hence perhaps muſt be concluded that greater Sounds paſs more ſwiftly, which diſagrees with divers obſervations. But when ſometimes theſe experiments ſhall be repeated, that I may number the ſeconds, I ſhall advertiſe, for as much as I conjecture that there is no ſwiftneſs of ſound greater than that, which I have proved of 230 fathoms for a ſecond; for in theſe ſmall matters I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that common ſaying, He that acts by another, ſeems to act by himſelf; who want not opportunites may obſerve for their own ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But now we ſhall add ſome thing concerning the ſwiftneſs of Bullets ſhot out of Guns. When therefore at the Marqueſſe of <hi>Doraiſons</hi> four leagues from the <hi>Sexti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> waters, I commanded a Braſſe Gun nine foot long, whoſe name was the <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> commonly called <hi>la Marquiſe,</hi> (whoſe Bullet was two pounds and an ounce, but quantity of Powder, ſuch as is wont to be in the uſe of leſſer Guns, the weight of one pound) to be levelled horizontally, with a plum line I found that the Bullet ſhot off Horizonitally, in the time of five ſeconds had paſſed over 630 fathoms or 3780 foot, and had reached the horizon, or fell to the ground, as was evident by the huge quantity of duſt raiſed by the blow.</p>
                  <p>Moreover that point of Earth which was firſt ſtruck by the Bullet was depreſſed under the horizon of the Gun 27 fathoms, for otherwiſe the Range ſhould not have been ſo great before its fall to the earth, which meets ſo much the more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by how much it is the more depreſſed under the Horizon of the Gun ſhot off, and I preſume I have attributed a leſſer ſwiftneſs to the Guns than is juſt, unleſs yet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42528:243"/> the Bullets of the greater Guns ſhot off with very fine powder, which we uſed, may exceed the ſwiftneſs of Bullets ſhot from Harquebuzes; of which thing I do not yet paſs judgement, till experiment, ſhall bring ſome further evidence: but I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome things newly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore of the Bullet which I made trial of, I affirm that the ſwiftneſs was ſo great that, at leaſt, in each ſecond minute it could paſs over 126 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, at leaſt, becauſe the obſervers know that the force on the Bullet doth go before the excuſſion or flaſh of the powder, and the perceiving thereof; ſo that half a ſecond may well be attributed to this time. Moreover in the firſt ſecond the Bullet paſſes more ſwiftly, in which time I doubt not but it paſſes over 150 fathoms; Laſtly, if by reaſon of that tarrying which happens betwen the ſmiting of the Earth until the duſt is ſeen to riſe, we ſhould augment that ſwiftneſs by ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms as it could paſs over in half a minute, to wit 70, and that the ſwiftneſs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed almoſt equal for the time of five ſeconds, and in each ſecond of that time that it paſſes over 140 fathoms, that is, if the point of the Earth firſt ſtruck were 700 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms diſtant from the Gun, it would reach it in the time of five ſeconds. Then the ſwiftneſs of the Bullet may be determined from what hath been ſaid, to be 130 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, at leaſt, in the time of a ſecond: which alſo agrees with the experiments of Bullets ſhot from leſſer Guns: to wit, they paſs an hundred fathoms in the ſame time as the Sound of the Gun hath the ſame paſſage.</p>
                  <p>For if, behind a wall that is to be ſtruck by the Bullet, the ear be attentive, in the ſame inſtant the ſound and the percuſſion of the Bullet is heard, as if the very Bullet had cauſed that Sound; which doubtleſs you ſhall find to be true as I did if you try: although it will be worth the labour to prove it, not only with that moſt refined powder, which they are wont to uſe who ſhoot at a mark for a wager, but alſo with the courſer ſort of Powder for great Guns, that it may be obſerved whether it cauſes any ſenſible difference of the ſwiftneſs.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever powder you uſe, the leaſt ſwiftneſs of the Bullet, may be defined in the firſt ſecond an hundred, the greateſt 150 fathoms, if you put but ſo much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the Gun as is neceſſary for a good ſhot; for if you put in but a few grains which can ſcarce ſhoot the Bullet off, another thing is to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I add that a Bullet ſhot vertically or Perpendicularly upright from the aforeſaid Gun in its aſcent and deſcent, ſpends 36 ſeconds: which if it ſpend ſo much time in its Riſe as in its fall, and that a heavy body deſcending in the time of 18 ſeconds alwayes keeps the ſame proportion in haſtening its deſcent which it keeps in the four firſt ſeconds, the Vertical aſcent ſhall be 648 fathoms, foraſmuch as a Bullet of ſix pound Weight of that Gun, which the Illuſtrious Knight <hi>Hugenius</hi> cauſed to be ſhot off at the <hi>Hague</hi> upon my requeſt, in its aſcent in the time of 16 ſeconds paſſed over 512 fathoms, which falling, pierced three foot into the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But two things there are which may leſſen the ſpace of the aſcent; firſt, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the bullet may not ſpend ſo much time in its aſcent as in its deſcent, becauſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in aſcending paſs over the ſame way in three ſeconds of time that in deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do in five ſeconds: furthermore ſhould we imagine to ſhoot with the mouth of the Gun towards the Earth, the Bullet would pierce deeper into the Earth, than by its mere fall, as it happens in Arrows: whence there ariſes in me no ſmall ſuſpicion that the eyes in the aſcent of the Bullet are deceived, to wit that the Bullet was even falling when it was yet eſteemed to aſcend: which alſo may be imagined of Arrows, which perhaps had began to deſcend when they ſhould ſeem to be inverted, that the point which went before aſcending ſhould likewiſe deſcending antecede: which you may conclude of from the ſmall blow of the Bullet deſcending, unleſs you may contend that the ſtroke made by the Bullet ſhot upright from the mouth of the Gun and falling upon the Earth very near, is greater indeed than the ſtroke of the ſame Bullet ſhot from the greateſt height, and that not by reaſon of the greater ſwiftneſs, but by reaſon of the air ſo unawares intercepted and oppreſſed, that it may much
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42528:243"/> better turn over or bore through the Earth, than when it is prepared for the laſt motion by the Bullet falling ſlowly.</p>
                  <p>Which indeed can be known by Rocks and Mountains 600 fathoms high, to wit, one ſtanding on the top ſhall obſerve what time the Bullet that is ſhot off at the foot of the Mountain, ſhall ſpend in coming to the top or any other place of the Mountain, and a ſign being given ſhall warn the leveller of the Gun of the time, or from it ſhall learn the time of the aſcent and deſcent: from which cutting off the time of the aſcent ſhall conclude how much ſhorter it ſhall be in the time of the deſcent; which alſo may be obſerved by an iron Bullet red-hot ſhot off in the night, whilſt it can be ſeen light to the greateſt height: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is I think fit to add the obſervation of that Holland Gun, which being levelly or horizontally ſhot off, carried a Bullet of ſix pounds 398 paces, before it firſt touched the Earth, taking a pace for three foot; after this Space it made eight leaps, and at length it ceaſed at 1750 paces: we have here expreſſed the diſtance between each leap, as likewiſe the diſtance of each grazing from the Gun.</p>

                  <p>Moreover a middle range of 45 degrees was 3225 paces, whoſe half if we take it for an upright or vertical ſhot, will be 3225 foot, or 537½ fathoms, for which before we counted only 512. Hence it comes to paſs that we may judge that a vertical ſhot in the aſcent doth not proceed by the ſame or equal and proportionable degrees of ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by which it falls in its deſcent, for at leaſt there are wanting 25 fathoms, by which 512 differ from 537, although that way of him that levelled the Gun, in counting by common paces, reſtrained to no rule, cannot be ſo certain, but that the other may differ from it, ſo that it cannot with undoubted certainty be reduced to our defined fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.</p>
                  <p>Whoever therefore would certainly try, let him have a chain or wheel for counting of fathoms or any other determinate meaſures, as is done in the paſſage of the league of 2500 fathoms from the <hi>Baſtilian</hi> Tower erected right over againſt Port Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> as for as the walls of the <hi>Vicennian</hi> Caſtle that firſt meet.</p>
                  <p>There remaines one thing that may diminiſh the upright height, to wit, that the Bullet ſpends more ſeconds in the deſcent than it ought, after it comes to the point of equality, after which it doth not any more augment its own ſwiftneſs: ſo that not only 16 ſeconds are to be reckoned for the deſcent of the Holland Bullet, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 20, and 12 are to be counted for the aſcent.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42528:244"/>
                  <p>For although in moderate heights of 40 or 50 fathoms, the acceſs to the point of equality, in leaden Bullets may not be ſufficiently obſerved, it does not thence follow that it comes not to ſuch a point, in greater heights of an hundred or more fathoms; yea experience proveth the Contrary.</p>
                  <p>Let there be taken a Corken Bullet which is at leaſt 70 times lighter than a leaden one, yet both them almoſt in the ſame time make a three foot ſpace, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Corke attains its point of equality within 50 foot.</p>
                  <p>But whether a leaden Bullet 70 times heavier, can paſs over a ſeventy fold ſpace, that is, 3500 foot, before it comes to its point of equality, which little differs from the height to which Bullets arrive that are vertically ſhot out of Guns, although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet conclude, yet it ſeemes probable enough to me. Moreover the force will never be augmented after the arival at that point, if the greater force ſhall be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from only the greater ſwiftneſs. But note, it hath been obſerved by a Noble man who related it to me, that a field Gun 18 foot long, and cut ſhorter foot by foot, did alwaies curry its ſhott the further till it came to be eleven foot long, and then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not to give ſo great a Range.</p>
                  <p>To which may be added from the experience of ſome in ſmall Guns, that if it be over charged with Powder, part of the Powder will blow out of the Gun without firing. Morever if the Bullet be not quite rammed home it will pierce the further, and the Gun recoyle the more.</p>
                  <p>Alſo that where the Gun is found moſt to furr with many ſhootings off with Powder, there it ought to be cut off, the remainder being the proper length requiſite.</p>
                  <p>It hath been related that a ſhip becalmed and tormented with the Cuſhee Piece of a Galley, that lay in a manner out of ſhot, was at the laſt reached by the induſtry of a Mariner, who wrapping up a much leſſer ſized Bullet than the Bore of the Gun made uſe of required, in a good Wad did ſhoot as far as the Galley, thereby retaliating the Injury received.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of the Depreſſion of ſhot below the Marke.</head>
                     <p>I Have often took care that a Gun ſhould be ſhot off commonly called an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz, at the ſpace of an hundred fathoms from the mark, that is, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot, which make three hundred common paces, and found that the Bullet was depreſſed under the mark-line eight or ten foot, which would ſcarce have made a greater ſpace, if it had fallen perpendicularly down at the ſame moment of time it was left off.</p>
                     <p>Again at the the Marqueſs of <hi>Doraiſons,</hi> a Bullet ſhot off, in the ſpace of five ſeconds of time fell 27 fathoms beneath its horizontal line or marke; and whereas perchance the riſing of the duſt, and the perceiving of it might make us loſe a ſecond of time, and that we retain only four ſeconds, then in each ſecond the Bullet ſhould be carried 157 ½ fathoms (ſurely not more) yet it ought to have deſcended 32 fathoms, if it deſcends ſo much horizontally ſhot off as it would naturally fall were it not ſhot off, and therefore it either loſes ſome thing of its deſcent by reaſon of its being ſhot off, or in running 360 fathoms, it ſpends not ſo much as four whole ſeconds of time, but rather about 3 ¾.</p>
                     <p>We add that ſomething is by this means abated from the ſwiftneſs of the fall for the ſpace of 27 fathoms which the Bullet in ſhooting off did deſcend, or fall below the marke: ſo that all things conſidered, I would not as yet ſtart from that opinion, which holds that two heavy bodies, to wit, two Bullets, whereof one may fall perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from its place above the Horizon,<note place="margin">Of this there is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between <hi>Borel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> who publiſhed a Treatiſe <hi>de vi percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis,</hi> the which was writ againſt by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norato Fabri</hi> in his Dialogues of Motion.</note> and the other be forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horizontally, ſhall both in the ſame moment of time arrive at the ground or Horizon: for example, if the pit of the aforeſaid <hi>Marqueſs</hi> be 27 fathoms deep, as indeed it is, if I rightly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or alſo a little deeper, 32. a Bullet ſhot into the fields incloſed between the Sextian waters, will hit the horizon, the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42528:244"/> that the like Bullet falling, ſhall the ſuperiour ſuperfice of the aforeſaid point of the water.</p>
                     <p>There is another thing that I may ſuſpect, whether or no the ſurveyour hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately enough meaſured the horizontal depreſſion; however it be, you ſee with what difficulties experiments are hedged in, and how much natural knowledge is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to them, who are enriching the ſame with exact Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>But note that the air that meets the bullet that is ſhot off does ſo much hinder or diminiſh its motion, as much as a wind of the ſame ſwiftneſs with the Ball, blowing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually againſt the ſame in a vacuum.</p>
                     <p>For is it not the ſame impediment, or deſtruction of the ſame force, if the bullet beats the aire or is beaten of it? But when I ſaid it was known by experience, that water does ſo much the more deſcend, by how much the ſlower it moves horizontally, and the ſame may ſeem to be concluded of other projected heavie bodies; I advertiſe that obſervations are not yet made ſo exact as that any thing of this nature ſhould be too poſitively aſſerted.</p>

                     <head>Of the Impediment of the Air.</head>
                     <p>IN regard that Bullets ſhot from Guns do about the end of their motion utter a more vehement noiſe or hiſſing than about the middle or onwards; there is no doubt to be made but that they move more ſlowly, and the force decreaſing as the ſwiftneſs, <hi>Merſennus</hi> concludes that the Curved range line deſcribed by a Bullets mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot exactly deſcribe a Parabola, but however the Theory is tolerable, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt violence to move in the touch line of a Parobola, and it is likely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mountures cauſe the greateſt difference, becauſe, there is ſo much the more Air beaten and removed by the paſſage of the ſhot.</p>
                     <p>But yet it is moſt hard to find out, how much the Air hinders; for although it ſeems to hinder ſo much, as the wind agitating the air with the ſame ſwiftneſs, ſtrikes upon the Bullet ſhot off; yet we are Ignorant of the force of that wind compared with the force of the Bullet ſhot off; unleſs we may appeale to our other experiments in which is ſhewn that the air is at leaſt a thouſand times lighter than water: and ſeeing that a leaden Bullet is eleven times heavier than water of the ſame bulke, a leaden Bullet will exceed the weight of the air 11000 times; and therefore the air agitated by the ſame ſwiftneſs of the Bullet, meeting with the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſeems to take away the 1100 part of the ſwiftneſs from the Bullet ſhot off.</p>
                     <p>Which impediment truly is ſo light, that in the deſcription of the Parabole it ſcarce ought to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe things are very excellent which the famous <hi>Torricellius</hi> hath ſet forth in his approved Treatiſe, to which <hi>Merſennus</hi> referrs his Reader.</p>

                     <hi>Experiments OF SHOOTING.</hi> Wherein is explained various obſervations concerning Guns; And what might happen to bullets ſhot off in a vacuity, diverſe waies compared with thoſe which are obſtructed in the Air.</head>
                  <p>WHenas I made trial about the ſhooting of Bullets in Guns only of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent bigneſs (which we commonly call Harquebuzes) which in the aſcent and deſcent together ſpend 22, 23 or 24 Seconds of time, <hi>Peter Petil</hi> a man moſt skilful and accurate in obſervations whileſt he lived at <hi>Francopolis,</hi> found (at my requeſt) the Range of a ſhot, out of a great gun, at the elevation of 22 degrees, whoſe iron Bullet weighed 33 pounds and ⅓, to be 1900 fathoms, which the Bullet flew or paſſed over in the ſpace of 20, 21 or 22 ſeconds; the Gun being placed at 8 fathoms in the Caſtle above ground or Horizon; from which place a Bullet of 12 pounds which ſo many pounds of gun-pouder ſhot off at the elevation of 16 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above the horizon, ſpent in the air 16 ſeconds.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, a Culverine of 12 foot long and horizontally levelled being 6 fathom high above the Horizon of the ocean and ſhot off, the Bullet, whoſe diameter was almoſt five Inches, continued 8 ſeconds of time in the air; when yet another Bullet whoſe diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was 6 Inches and ½, alſo horizontally ſhot off out of an other Gun 12 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, its Bullet ſpent 24 ſeconds in the Air.</p>
                  <p>An Iron Culverine of 10 foot long, whoſe Bullet, had a diameter of almoſt four inches, horizontally levelled, and ſtanding 9 fathoms above the ſurface or brim of the Sea, ſpent only three ſeconds, in its horizontal Range, after which grazing five times above the Ocean, ſpent four other ſeconds.</p>
                  <p>Three daies alſo before the taking of <hi>Theoud, Robervallus</hi> our Geometer obſerved, the Bullets of Guns ſhot off from the City againſt our Souldiers, for the moſt part to ſpend only 14 ſeconds of time in the air, after which there was a hiſſing increaſed more and more until the force and motion of the Bullet was almoſt quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and that after the ſhot had flew almoſt half a league.</p>
                  <p>Which being ſuppoſed it may be Theorically concluded, how great the ſhoots ought to be at whatſoever elevation above the horizon, if they be in ſuch Proportion one to another, as ſhots in a Vacuity, no Medium hindring; that is, for example, if the range of 45 degrees be double the height of the Perpendicular or vertical ſhot in a ſpace not hindring, ſo is the range of 45 in the air to the vertical in the air, and ſo of the reſt; which obſervations only will teach; which yet are moſt difficult in the greater ſort of Guns or Bows, eſpecially the perpendicular, whoſe height we can ſcarce certainly know, unleſs ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>No Towers ſurely are high enough; and by the time of the deſcent or fall of the Bullet, to conclude a place may be found to which bullets, darts, or other things that are caſt upright or vertically aſcending, do come, doth therefore fail, becauſe they do not obſerve the ſame rule of ſwiftneſs in deſcending; as is evident from darts, to which ſeeing it happens in their aſcent or riſe of 50 fathoms to be ſlackned in their deſcent or fall, ſomething like this may be alſo thought to happen to Bullets, to wit, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the height of a thouſand fathoms.</p>
                  <p>But you may avoid theſe difficulties: for if from that rock in the <hi>Dolphinate,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42528:245"/> height 'tis ſaid is 600 fathoms or more, a ſtone or bullet of Iron or any other matter be let fall,<note place="margin">Experiments of this kind the Reader will doubtleſs find, as alſo others about <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums</hi> in the <hi>Opuſcula Poſthuma</hi> of <hi>I. Bap. Batiani.</hi>
                     </note> the time of its falling being noted, as for example, if in the ſpace of 18 ſeconds it fall from the height of 648 fathoms (as truly it ſhould fall, if the ſpaces be in Duplicate <hi>ratio,</hi> or as the ſquare of the times in the whole deſcent) then we have rightly judged before of the vertical altitude or perpendicular ſhot (which the Bullet of an indifferent Gun reaches) that is the height of 288 fathoms; which yet I cannot credit; otherwiſe the middle ſhot or range of 45 degrees of that Gun at leaſt would be double to that perpendicular or vertical one, that is to ſay, it would be 576 fathoms, whenas I found it not 400 fathoms.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe obſervations I ſhall add thoſe which the induſtrious <hi>Galeus</hi> an Engineer to divers Dukes in whoſe preſence he made them, writ with his own hand and gave me, which that you may more eaſily underſtand, let the greater Gun K, which we commonly call a Cannon, be parallel to the Horizon, and let the eye be taking aim by the points I and O, the horizontal ſhot being ſuppoſed O P, or in the figure beneath, S X, or, T V, he ſayes that the remainder of the rang which bends till it touches the horizon in the point λ, is almoſt equal to the horizontal ſhot, that is, that there is almoſt as much ſpace made by the bullet from that point, from which it begins to bend towards the horizon, until it touch it, as it had made before the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                  <figure>
                     <figDesc>cannon range</figDesc>
                  </figure>
                  <p>But now let us ſuppoſe that horizontal ſhot OP, or TV, removed to the lower figure in which let AB be the horizontal plain, and let the the aforſaid horizontal ſhot be AI, <hi>Galeus</hi> contends that the middle range of 45 degrees, which is the longeſt of all, is eleven fold the length of the horizontal ſhot OP, or AI: And in thoſe Guns which are half the weight of the foregoing greater Guns, to be in reſpect of AI, as 10 and ½ is to 1, and in leſſer Guns as 10 to 1 that is our figure, as A B in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of A I; in which the middle range is AGEB; for that is the middle range
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42528:246"/> which paſſes through the middle of the quadrant φ 5, which they call the ſixth point, becauſe it is the middle part of the half circumference A, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, divided into 12 equal parts; which joyned to the quadrant φ 5, may be uſeful for levelling the gun at any elevation above the horizon, if it ſhall be divided not only into 12 parts, but alſo into an 180 degrees.</p>
                  <p>And hence he concludes that the dead or exact Horizontal Shot or range, that is in the figure, R λ I to be in Proportion to the middle range as 1 to 6; or in leſſer Guns, as one to five; which dead Horizontal ranges is to the range of an Elevation of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as five to ſix, or more exactly as 55 to 67, or as 14 to 17.</p>
                  <p>But when the recoyling of the greater Gun is hindred, the dead Horizontal range will be greater by a ſeventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth part, than that range which is made with recoyling; in leſſer Guns it will be a twelfth or a fifteenth part leſs.</p>
                  <p>Moreover he aſſerts that the middle range A 6 E does proceed righton without arching by the line A G, which may be almoſt equal to A 5, that is, almoſt 5 fold or 4 ½ the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal ſhot: then not only that it does aſcend to the point D, ſo that the greateſt height of the middle range may be fourfold the Horizontal, and be over the line AC ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the ſame which ſome affirm; but he by obſervation ſaies is falſe againſt <hi>Tartaglia;</hi> affirming that the greateſt altitude muſt be F E, anſwering the point 7, that is ſeven diſtances of Horizontal range from the gun A, that FE may be almoſt five fold the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal range.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galeus</hi> did likewiſe well conjecture that the Curve for the middle range does come near to the Curve of an hyperbolical or parabolical line, and that not by force of reaſon, but only from obſervations. Moreover the greateſt range at forty five degrees elevation he makes 16200 foot, that is 2700 of the <hi>French</hi> fathoms; who becauſe he uſed feet leſs than ours, you might account it for 2500 fathoms, that the ſaid range may anſwer to our league, and that the bullet might paſs through the air in near half a minute, or 30 ſeconds of time: and becauſe the dead Horizontal range may be 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the utmoſt, it will be 2700 foot or 450 fathoms, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed the Horizontal range will ſcarce exceed 200 fathoms.</p>

                     <head>The Ranges of Spouts or Squirts compared with the Ranges of Bullets ſhot out of Guns.</head>
                     <p>FOr as much as a Bullet ſpends a greater time in its fall than its riſe, like darts; or the deſcent is not ſo ſwift, that it ſhould always haſten in that degree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in three or four ſeconds, we have found its ſwiftneſs to be increaſed, which I ſuppoſe to be confirmed from this reaſon, becauſe a bullet deſcending cannot have ſo great a power to ſmite, as it hath aſcending, ſo that approaching the Earth it is not ſo ſwiftly moved, as when it comes from the mouth of the Gun, for when the ſwiftneſs of any thing projected is equall, it equally ſtrikes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I account Spouts uſeful, ſeeing they bring us to the knowledg of ſhooting, of which otherwiſe we could not judge, by reaſon of the difficulty of trial which is moſt eaſily diſcerned in tubes: for becauſe any one may compare in a little time what ever ſhot he pleaſes with another, to wit,<note place="margin">Former Figure.</note> a middle Range with a vertical, or Perpendicular one as to time and height, that this may be the better underſtood, in the following figure let the Cock be A above the Horizon A B, and let the altitude of the tube be A 12, whoſe vertical Squirt is A φ, Experience teacheth us that the length of the middle Squirt A B, is double to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical A φ.</p>
                     <p>But to what height the middle Squirt ranges, whether to D or E, which alſo you may underſtand of Bullets ſhot from Guns, there is none hitherto hath obſerved: but it is one half of the vertical φ A, wherefore the point D or E is higher than it ought to be, and whatever is ſaid by the ingenious, may be corrected by ſpouts.</p>
                     <p>There are other things alſo that want inquiry into; for example, how it can come to paſs, that a bullet ſhot out of the mouth of a Gun from O to P comes right on, when in that time it flying along the line O P a hundred fathoms ought to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the center of the Earth 12 foot, if the horizontal motion of a thing violently projected hinders not its natural motion, as many imagine in a vacuity or place that does not impede.</p>
                     <p>For although that can partly be explained by the diverſity of the lines, which is found in Guns, to wit the line R X Y, which follows the outſide of the Gun, and that which they call <hi>Linea animae</hi> S Z, which paſſes thorough the axis of the hollow M N to the aforeſaid ſide, is in no wiſe parallel: becauſe, to wit, the bullet K or H levelling at L may aſcend to the ſide line I L, or the point S paſſing to Z may aſcend to the point X of the ſide line R Y: yet another thing is to be added, when what is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid is not true, when the eye of the ſhooter takes not aim by the line I L or R X but by the line M N or S X: for then the bullet K does not deſcend ſo much, as it would if it were left to it ſelf in the air.</p>
                     <p>Add, that the water out of the Cock fitted to the Horizontal Squirt doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo much, as it would if left to it ſelf; for it is manifeſt by Experience, that the Horizontal Squirt of 30 foot, which continues two ſeconds, deſcends not ſo much as eight foot, when according to the law of bodies of equal weight, it ſhould be 48, or at leaſt by reaſon of the reſiſtance of the air breaking the water it ought to deſcend 30 foot.</p>

                  <head>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the year of our Lord <hi>1639.</hi> (being the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of my age) having a great inclination to the Wars, and my Genius leading me principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſtudies of Fortification, Artillery, Fire-works, Mines, and the like; I was firſt of all entertained in the ſervice of the States, where I continued about four years; during which time I obſerved with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the Manners and Cuſtoms uſed in theſe Countries, as well in the buſineſs of Encamping and Retrenching, as in Erecting their Fortifications. But hearing very much of the <hi>French</hi> and other Nations, for their marvellous Addreſs and Dexterity in all Warlike Affairs, I was extreamly deſirous to be better acquainted with their ways, as promiſing my ſelf to ſee wonders done by them: Wherefore I went with a Regiment of <hi>Walloons</hi> from <hi>Maſtricht</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> in quality of a Lieutenant; which Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was joyned to the Army of the Duke d' <hi>Enguin</hi> (who was then General of the <hi>French</hi>) and ſo they kept together till the Battel of <hi>Frybourg</hi> in <hi>Briſgow, 1644.</hi> where the ſaid Regiment was wholly routed, and I with many other miſerable Wretches ſhared together in our Misfortune; however with that Army we reduced the <hi>Palatinat</hi> by the <hi>Rhyne, Frankendal</hi> onely excepted. Being ſince returned into <hi>France,</hi> I had the advantage of ſeeing there many places well Fortified, as alſo in <hi>Burgundy, Lorraine,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and did examine very curiouſly their Principles of War, together with the various Methods of Fortifying, attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing, defending, and embattailing their Armies, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germane,</hi> againſt the <hi>Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> and <hi>Bavarians,</hi> to which we were not altogether ſtrangers. Thus having ſeen whatever I thought neceſſary in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I aſsiſted at the Battel of <hi>Nortlingen,</hi> in and near the Village of <hi>Alderheym 1645.</hi> where the Duke d' <hi>Enguin</hi> was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>French,</hi> V. C. <hi>Tureyn</hi> of the <hi>Waymarians,</hi> and <hi>Merci</hi> of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> which laſt was ſlain in the Fight. After this, having aſsiſted in the Battel of <hi>Herbrauſen</hi> near <hi>Mariedal,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42528:252"/> I reſolved to ſeek my fortune in ſome other Countrey, to ſee what was there to be done, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Cuſtoms and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like practices being ſufficiently known to me already. Conſequently in the year <hi>1646.</hi> hearing that the <hi>Turks</hi> had invaded <hi>Candia,</hi> and declared War againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> I had great inclinations to follow that War, (beſides the curioſity I had to ſee thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) as being againſt the moſt inveterate and irreconcileable enemy of Chriſtendom. Whereupon I left the <hi>German</hi> Camp (for I was then come from the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Waymarians</hi>) where I had ſerved for the ſpace of three years, in divers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and endured many hard and tedious Marches, hazarded my ſelf often in bloudy Battels and famous Rencounters, with the loſs of moſt of my Comrades and fellow-Souldiers, who were either ſlain in fight, or otherwiſe lost their lives in the Service. From thence I firſt ſteered my courſe to <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and being arrived at <hi>Zurich,</hi> I met with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour, and other <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Officers, with whom I made an agreement to levy <hi>German</hi> Souldiers, and to lead them over the Alps into <hi>Italy (Bergamo</hi> in <hi>Lombardy</hi> being the place appointed for our Rendezvouz) where having been a while, and obſerved the moſt eminent Fortifications on the Continent, we got Letters to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> from whence ſome of us were ſent for <hi>Candia,</hi> others for <hi>Corfu,</hi> and I with ſome <hi>German</hi> Forces for <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which was already invaded and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Boſna, Macedonia,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who made great preparations to aſſault the Strong-Holds in thoſe parts. Here, by the intreaty of <hi>Foſcolo</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, I took upon me the employment of Engineer, and had many ſtrange Adventures, too numerous to be here recited. About five years after, <hi>Lunardo Foſcolo,</hi> then General in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> was choſen General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſsimo in <hi>Candia,</hi> who deſired me to accompany him thither. But when we came to <hi>Venice,</hi> his journey was retarded, and I employed my time in curing ſome Diſtempers I had gotten in the Wars, in the <hi>Paduan</hi> Baths; and afterwards returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> where I found the General, having got leave from the Senate, reſolved to continue that ſummer at <hi>Venice.</hi> Whereupon being deſirous to viſit my friends and relations in my native Countrey, I took my leave, and went for <hi>Germany,</hi> and by the way had an opportunity of ſeeing ſome Fortifications of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and ſome others, which before I might not, becauſe I ſerved their enemies. Being in the Low-Countreys, I had an opportunity of offering my ſervice to my Lords the Burgamaſters of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in whoſe ſervice I am at preſent employed, and hope, as occaſion ſhall offer, I ſhall be able ſo
<pb facs="tcp:42528:253"/> to improve my talent, as to bring to light that which may be for the advantage of this great City, and the whole Countrey. In the mean time I ſhall begin with this ſmall Treatiſe, the Subject whereof is the doctrine of Fortifications; not that I intend to diſcourſe of the firſt Rudiments, but onely to manifest unto thoſe who understand this Science, the weakneſs of Modern Fortifications, and how the defects may be ſupplied, and the Works made incomparably ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well the Royal Fortreſſes, as the Outworks, and all this with as ſmall coſt as ordinarily other Works are erected. Which expedients are no Chimeras or idle Fancies, but ſuch as have been ſufficiently diſputed of and throughly examined. For I have made it my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to obſerve very ſtrictly the proper function of each distinct part of a Fortification, and that not in a Cloſet, but abroad, and in the Field, together with the manifold ways of improving them; and have diſcourſed and debated the ſame with the most excellent Engineers of this our age. I do not mean with ſuch who attacque Cities by a fire-ſide or in a chimney-corner, but with ſuch who have been trained up among the Canons and Muskets: nor do I mean with our ordinary Mathematicians, who think that Wars, and all affairs of this world ought to be regulated unchangeably after their rules. Neither do I hereby in any wiſe deſpiſe or under value Mathematical Learning; for on the contrary, I lay that for my foundation and groundwork, having for my own particular ſtudied it with great affection and delight. But becauſe I have found by experience, that the Principles of War are not always limited to Mathematical Rules, therefore I do not begin this Treatiſe with Demonſtrations, but declare my opinion to the lovers of this kind of learning as plainly and as briefly as I can; not thinking it neceſſary to ſhew how to erect a Fortification, but onely to point at ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Amendments, which will, I doubt not, be very grateful to all ingenious Students. And in caſe there be any thing found which they cannot approve of, they will highly oblige me whenever they pleaſe to declare the ſame, and to propound expedients for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of whatever is amiſs. But foraſmuch as I do not doubt but that this little Treatiſe will find acceptance, I ſhall God willing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto the world my particular reflections and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for Attacquing, Defending, Artillery, Mines, Counter-Mines, with all other things relating thereto, as likewiſe for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and forming of Battels; all which have been found to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, and of great uſe in the late Wars.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had throughly conſidered the beſt Methods of Fortification practiſed in the Countries before mentioned, I found that none of them had made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of Situations (as to the Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part) then the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> Foraſmuch as they have not onely very well deſigned and contrived their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, but have alſo placed them ſo advantagiouſly, that by the overflowing of Waters (which they can by the opening of Slu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces let in or out as they pleaſe) they have rendred the greateſt part of the Works impregnable. I do not ſay but that in other Countries are alſo found very ſufficient Fortreſſes, and well contrived; but there hath been a neceſſity in theſe Provinces (where they have had to deal with ſo potent an Enemy) to uſe greater caution and circumſpection then elſewhere, and to make choice of the beſt Fortifications, and yet with no great charge, being made of Earth onely, which of all Materials I hold to be the beſt for this purpoſe; whereas in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> they are of opinion, that the outſides of their Works ought to be altogether of Stone, and afterwards cut or pared, which cannot be done without exceſſive charge. And yet notwithſtanding all their endeavours, they have not been able ſo to contrive their Strong-Holds, but that the beſt of them, if acceſſible, are taken in a ſhort time, being hardly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for three Moneths, to the aſtoniſhment of the World, as examples do abundantly teſtifie. This hath been the cauſe why
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42528:255"/> many Military Architects have tryed all ways and means to ſupply thoſe Defects, of which I have ſeen many Conceits, but in my judgement altogether impracticable; which has encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me to improve my own Obſervations in all Occurrences, and earneſtly to mind each part of the Fortification, of what uſe it might be, and whether it were able to perform that, for which it was ordained and intended. And having diſcovered very many Errors, eſpecially in the Modern Flanques and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, I did debate my Obſervations very particulary with many Engineers of the greateſt Practice and Renown; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any whoſe judgement I ſo well approved, as that of a certain noble <hi>Italian,</hi> who having had ſeveral Employments, as well in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> as likewiſe in the <hi>French</hi> Warrs, had carefully improved all opportunities and advantages of gaining Knowledge and Experience. With this Gentleman I therefore made a particular Acquaintance and Friendſhip, and we did mutually communicate and compare together our Obſervations, till ſuch time as we had found out, and agreed upon ſuch a Method, as ſeemed to us to be of all other the ſafeſt, and yet practicable with the leaſt expence; according to which Method, almoſt all conſiderable Fortifications might without difficulty be redreſſed. The truth is, this Method is ſomething near that which ſhall hereafter be diſcourſed of: For having look'd yet more narrowly into this matter, and examin'd it with greater diligence and curioſity, I did onely (as I found cauſe) alter ſomething of that our firſt deſign. I do not here undertake to make Acceſſible places impregnable, ſince all that is made by man, may by man be again deſtroyed; for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques being carryed on upon a ſure foot, and the Approaches being managed with skill and judgement, if in the mean time no relief come, even the ſtrongeſt places muſt at length yield up to the Beſiegers. My intention is onely ſo to contrive Works, that they may reſiſt much longer then ordinarily they do, that ſo the Beſiegers may be waſted and conſumed, either by ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or ſome other accidents. (For by lengthening of time, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is given to the Beſieged to get relief; or in the mean while to Attaque ſome other places in the Enemies cuſtody, and ſo to make him quit his deſign;) which will be a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the pains and charge, which I conceive to be but little more then ordinary, in caſe the Work be managed by an experienced Artiſt, as will ſufficiently appear by what hereafter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42528:255"/> follows. In the mean time I ſhall propound ſome general Rules or Principles of Fortifications, approved and owned by many skilful Captains and Engineers.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>The Maxims or general Rules which are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Modern Fortifications.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. There ought to be no point of the whole Fortification undiſcovered or unflanqued, and that from ſeveral places of Defence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Lines defending ought to be longer then the Lines defended, or at leaſt as long.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Regular Fortification is very much ſtronger then an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The more Baſtions a Regular place hath, the greater is its Strength and Defence.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Fortreſs ought to command all places whatſoever round about.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe parts of a Fortreſs which are neareſt to the Center, ought to command thoſe that are more remote.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thoſe parts of a Fortification which are at greateſt diſtance from the Center, ought always to be Commanded by thoſe that are neareſt the Center.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Line of Defence <hi>Fichante,</hi> ought not to be much longer then 60 Rods, that being the diſtance ordinarily allowed for the Port of a Musket.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The larger the Flanques and Gorges are, the better and ſtronger they are, provided the other parts are not prejudiced thereby.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Of ſecond Flanques, and Courtine-Flanques, the larger is the better, in caſe it cauſe no diſproportion in the other parts of the Fortification.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As for the <hi>Linea Stringens,</hi> (or Line of Defence <hi>Secant,</hi> which is continued from the Face to the Courtine) the ſhorter it is, the better, if the Flanques be not too much leſſened by it.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That opening of the Angle of a Baſtion is the beſt, which gives a right length to the Flanque, ſecond Flanque, and Gorge.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Angle of a Baſtion ought not to be leſs then 60 degrees, nor greater then a Right Angle, or 90 degrees.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42528:256"/>14. The Angle of the Poligone ought not to be leſs then 90 degrees.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Angle of the Face and Flanque ought to be at leaſt 150 degrees.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Angle of the Courtine and Flanque ought to be evermore 90 degrees, or a Right Angle.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The outward Angle of Defence (or <hi>Angle Flanquant</hi>) cannot well be too Acute.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The inward Angle of Defence ought not to be leſs then 25 degrees.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The proportion between the Courtine and the Face ought to be as 3 to 2, or as 36 to 24.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The Faces ſhould never be longer then the Courtine, nor ſhorter then one half of the Courtine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Maxims and Rules for the ſtructure of moſt of the Modern Fortifications, which I hold to be exceeding good and neceſſary, all but the 16th, which ſays, That the Angle of the Flanque and Courtine muſt always be a Right Angle. As for the reaſon of that Poſition, we ſhall ſee more hereafter. For I do aſſert the contrary, and ſay, That it ought always to exceed 90 degrees: which Angle is the onely thing that makes the difference in the form of my Ground-Lines from thoſe now in uſe; beſides that, I take greater Parts, and other Profiles. The truth is, the Flanques are the moſt conſiderable parts of a Fortification, and thoſe wherein lies its chiefeſt Strength, and therefore the Structure of thoſe is of ſo much the greater conſequence. But now the reaſons of thoſe who would have the Flanque evermore perpendicular to the Courtine, are theſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe all Shots coming from thence flie parallel to the Courtine; and that by night all parts of the Courtine may be better defended; and that when it is very dark, the Souldiers holding their Muſquets in a right Angle to their Breaſts, muſt needs hinder the Enemy from approaching the Courtine, as may be ſeen in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reaſons being well ſcann'd and examin'd, appear ſo weak, that they are ſcarce worth the anſwering; nevertheleſs I ſhall briefly refute them. The firſt reaſon is, becauſe the Shots flie all parallel with the Courtine: whereupon I ſay, whether the Flanque be perpendicular to the Courtine or no, the Shots may for all that flie parallel with the Courtine; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42528:256"/> the Souldiers know not how to make a Right Angle in ſetting their Muſquets. I do alſo affirm, That onely one Muſqueteer can with one Shot clear the whole Courtine at once, and all the reſt muſt incline to it; for if they do flie parallel, then thoſe who give the Aſſaults muſt have Wings likewiſe, that ſo they may be ſhot in the Air, in caſe thoſe within are to defend the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Wall, or elſe the Shots muſt flie onely the height of four or five foot above the Horizon (as out of the Fauſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray) that ſo they may keep parallel to the Horizon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwiſe; the Flanques in theſe Fortifications are eighteen or twenty foot high, and all Shots go downwards, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hit the Horizon in one place onely. The principal duty of a Muſqueteer is, that by night-time he turn himſelf with his Muſquet towards the place where he heareth a noiſe, or ſeeth fire, or ſomething elſe; to which neither the Perpendicularity nor the Obliquity of Flanques can give any advantage, or become the leaſt hindrance. And theſe parallel-ſhots are onely Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, found out upon the Ground-Lines, which in the Profile come far otherwiſe, as <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. <hi>Num.</hi> 1. ſheweth. The Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer <hi>A</hi> ſtanding upon the Flanque, which is Perpendicular to the Courtine, cleareth the upper part of it: in caſe the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetteer <hi>B</hi> do the ſame, and Shooteth parallel with <hi>A;</hi> but then his Bullet flieth ſo far from the Wall, as he himſelf ſtandeth off from his fellow; and ſo likewiſe all the reſt that ſtand along in the ſame Line. Whence it followeth, That thoſe who aſſault, muſt be upon the Wing, or in the Ayr, or elſe are not to be hit by theſe parallel-ſhots: but let the others without the Point <hi>A,</hi> as <hi>C, D,</hi> &amp;c. not Shoot paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with <hi>A,</hi> then their Shots cannot hit either the Courtine or Moat, or Bridge, but in one place onely; which in an Oblique Flanque of an equal height, will be the ſame. Now as for my Flanques, I order them after another Method, and therefore they are of far greater Advantage then the former, or any other that were ever yet in uſe, which any Artiſt may eaſily conceive, when he vieweth onely the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, although no Explanation or Animadverſion were made upon it, in caſe he will but declare his judgement without partiality, according to right reaſon, and the practice of War.</p>
                     <p>The Flanques or Defending-Lines are the chiefeſt part of the Fortification, and ought therefore to be conſidered in the firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42528:257"/> place. They have been altered ſeveral times already, but never with any advantage comparable to what is obtained by theſe; which advantage is diſtributed and has an influence upon all the parts of the Fortification. The Flanques with Caſematts are odious in the United Provinces, becauſe their <hi>Orillons</hi> could not ſtand, unleſs they were Walled up with Stone, which is too charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as likewiſe by their Cutting and Retiring of the Flanques mounted with Canon, the entrance of the Bulworks came to be too little, which in my Work is otherwiſe. Thoſe who view my Bulworks, and do not underſtand the Profiles, may alſo imagine, that they are made with Caſematts; but it is very far from that, and there is ſomething elſe in it, which hereafter ſhall be ſufficiently declared and explained: onely let no man flatter himſelf with an opinion, that foraſmuch as ſo many brave Captains and Engineers have employed the beſt of their underſtandings and endeavours to arrive at the utmoſt perfection of this Art of Fortification, it cannot be, but that they have attained unto it: Whereas in the late Wars it hath been obſerved, and is daily ſeen, that the beſt Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, made after the manner aforeſaid, can ſcarce reſiſt ſo much as two Moneths; and it is altogether needleſs to produce Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of that which ſo many Hiſtories do atteſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, we are to know, that the braveſt Captains and Engineers of this Age knew very well the imperfection of the Modern Flanques, and therefore they have made it their buſineſs to think of it, and the truth is, many have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with me about it; but I did not find the Inventions propounded by them, practicable in all places: and in this Countrey it hath not been minded, becauſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> did ſeldom or never Attacque any place of conſequence with an induſtrious force; but being Beſieged in any of their own places, did eaſily Surrender it, without troubling themſelves much with the knowledge of Engineerſhip. But I ſhall leave this Subject, and come to my purpoſe, which is not to teach the Grounds or firſt Rudiments of Fortification, but onely to Inſtruct the Ingenious Lovers of that Art, how to reform thoſe errors which in theſe late furious and induſtrious Wars have been rightly diſcovered in the Modern Fortifications. I ſtile them furious and induſtrious, becauſe no Hiſtory gives a relation of any War that was carried on with greater fury, or of any Cities that were taken with greater induſtry.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42528:257"/>
                     <p>In the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, I ſhall manifeſt the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Modern Fortification, and in order thereunto, I ſhall begin firſt from the Ground-Lines, and propound a part of a Regular Fortreſs of Eleven Bulworks, according to the practice of <hi>Fryday</hi> and other Modern Mathematicians, whoſe Method I eſteem to be much better then thoſe of former Ages. But before I proceed, the Enemies of Strong-Holds ought in the firſt place to be known, which are Sappes, Spades, Pikes, Canon, Mines, and Muſquets, managed by Souldiers, and Commanded by skilfull Captains and Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers: And foraſmuch as the very ſame things are to be made uſe of for Defence, it is neceſſary that the Fortreſſes, to the end they may be convenient for uſe, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it long before. Now this cannot be practiſed in ſmall Works, where after the ſpringing of one Mine, all is loſt. It is alſo neceſſary, that the Works ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly be defended, as well with Canon as with Muſquets, by a greater number of men, and from more places of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then can be done by the Enemy conveniently in his Attacques; And herein conſiſteth the vertue of a Fortification: For if the Enemy do find place to make a Battery of ſix or eight Pieces, to break the Flanques; we ought to have a commodious place to plant Twenty eight or Thirty pieces in Contra-Battery, which will ſoon ruine the Enemies Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, being greater in number, and ſtanding already in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious places; whereas the Enemy muſt firſt raiſe his Battery under the danger of thoſe Canon-ſhots. All which being premiſed and well conſidered, let us now inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Modern Fortreſſes have this conveniency; and if not, where the difference lies. For example, ſee <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 2. which is part of a Work of eleven Baſtions, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified after the beſt Modern Method and Practice, (being <hi>Fryday</hi>'s ſecond Way) and according to the meaſure of theſe following Lines.</p>

                     <p>The Modern Engineers refer themſelves much to the ſtrength of their Out-works, whereof ſome nevertheleſs are very Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering-Holes, more troubleſome then uſeful; as I ſhall prove in due time: but for the preſent ſhall onely ſhew, how the faults of Modern Fortifications may be Rectified according to my Method.</p>
                     <p>It is notorious to every one, who underſtands Fortifications, according to the Maxims above-mentioned, that the longer the Defending Lines are, the better they are; and that according to <hi>Axiome</hi> 9. the longer Flanques and Gorges, are much the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42528:261"/> ſtronger; always provided, they may be made without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to other parts, or that they be weakened thereby: As alſo, that the great Bulworks are better then the little ones, becauſe Retrenchments and Counter-mines may be made within them; and becauſe more Pieces of Canon and Muſqueteers may be placed there, for the defence of the next Bulwork; and becauſe it is fitter for all other Warlike actions. It is alſo notorious, that the longeſt Polygones and Regular Fortreſſes contain moſt room, and therefore ought to be preferred before the ſhorter, in caſe the Lines of Defence in the Fortification do not exceed the reach of a Muſquet, that is, 60 or 70 Rods; for after this manner more ſpace is included with fewer Bulworks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with leſs charges. The other Maxims are alſo very ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved in my Fortifications.</p>
                     <p>Now to obtain all theſe Advantages, I deſcribe in <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 2. the Ground-Lines of part of an Eleven-angled Work, according to <hi>Fryday,</hi> as alſo part of an Eleven-angled Work, according to my own practice, both of them Fortified after our ſecond Methods of Fortifying. Which is the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the fitteſt for Cities of an ordinary extent: but to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie very great Towns, it will be better to make uſe of the third Method. I ſhall therefore ſhew firſt the difference of Lines in our two Methods, and afterwards the manner of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Work unto practice.

                     <p>Here the difference of Lines is clearly ſeen; and that my Figure of eleven Angles containeth in the Circuit of its exterior Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42528:261"/> 130. 57 ① more than that of <hi>Fryday</hi>'s; for his eleven Polygones are 859.43 ① in length, and my eleven 990 ⓪, and my Line of Defence is no more than 2.72 ① longer than his, which is little or no difference; my Flanques, Gorges, and conſequently whole Bulworks are much larger, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. My Bulworks-Angle, (or Angle Flanqued) is equal to his; as alſo the Angle of the Polygone, and the Angle of the <hi>Tenaille,</hi> and the Faces are as long as the Courtines. My Flanques defend the next Bulworks, Faces and Moats, at right Angles: So that all parts do mutually defend themſelves with great conveniencie. Here it is to be obſerved, That I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude very near as much ſpace with nine of my Bulworks, as <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> doth with eleven of his, keeping very near the ſame Line of Defence; which eaſeth the Charges very conſiderably, beſides the great Symetry of the Work. And this is all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Ground-Lines; the vertue of this Work will be ſeen by that which follows. I ſhall proceed now to the Structure of theſe Fortifications, and how the proportions of Lines are to be found. I doubt not, but there be many <hi>Theorici,</hi> which underſtand the uſe of Fortifications no otherwiſe than upon the Paper, who will imagine, that this Work cannot be good, ſeeing the Flanques do not (according to the profound Error before mentioned) ſtand Perpendicular to the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; not conſidering what ſtrength the Bulworks have by this Obliquity, not onely thoſe that are next, but alſo thoſe that are ſituated on the other ſide. For hereby the Bulworks gain at the entrance upon each Gorge, the length <hi>D I,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 8 ⓪ twice, which is 16 Rods gained upon both the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo that the entrance of the Bulwork cometh to be 48 Rods. This affordeth place enough to Lodge upon the Flanques the ſuppoſed Artillery and Souldiers, which I eſteem neceſſary. It affordeth alſo room for the making of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and the Flanques come to be much longer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, as is proved by the 47 of the firſt of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid.</hi> It maketh alſo the great Line of Defence to keep its due meaſure, not ſurpaſſing the length of 64 ⓪, which is the true reach of a Muſquet. Although my Polygones be conſiderably longer, yet the Lines of Defence are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly longer than thoſe of <hi>Fryday</hi>'s, and others. I am alſo of opinion, That the Modern Flanques are more for an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42528:262"/> beauty, than to make good the Defence, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is the main end for which they are made, and wherein conſiſteth the ſtrength of Fortreſſes.</p>

                     <p>TO do this, I ſtate firſt my exterior Polygones, after which I regulate the proportions of the whole Work. For the exterior Polygone of the <hi>little Royal,</hi> I take 80 ⓪, for that of <hi>mean Royal</hi> 90 ⓪, and for the exterior Polygone of the <hi>great Royal</hi> 100 ⓪; and I follow the ſame proportions in the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating of my Lines, which <hi>Fryday</hi> hath, that is, making the Courtine to the Face, as 36 to 24, or as 3 to 2; but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that I take my parts greater, and redreſs them, after the firſt Poſition is done. This Calculation is done onely by the Rule of Three, thus: Admit there is a place to be Fortified with a Regular Fortification of four, five, ſix, or more Angles, and that after the firſt, ſecond, or third of my Methods; I take then the Lines of ſuch a Polygone, as the Fortreſs ſhould be, that I intend to make, out of <hi>Fryday</hi>'s Tables. For example, I would make a Square after my firſt Method; I take then out of the Tables the length of the Lines; as 24 ⓪ for the Faces; 36 the Courtines; for the Gorges 9.23 ②; for the Capital 19.73 ②; for the Flanque 7.74 ②; and ſo for all the Lines: theſe Lines I lay before me, and ſay, by the Rule of Three, If the exterior Polygone of a Square of <hi>Fryday</hi>'s, being 82.36 ②, giveth me the Courtine 36 ⓪, what does my exterior Polygone of 80 ⓪ after the firſt Method in the great Royal, give me for my Courtine? and the anſwer is, 34.97 ②.</p>
                     <p>Item, the exterior Polygone giveth for the Face, according to <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> 82.36 ②—24 ⓪.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Lines and others that may be required, being found by the foregoing Rules, I delineated the Figure (whether it be a Fortreſs of five, ten, eleven or more Angles) according to Art, as here in the Figure <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. the Square, which I hold to be the firſt Figure capable of being Fortified. This being drawn according to the Modern Practice, I redreſs the Ground-Lines according to my Method, very eaſily thus: I lengthen the Faces at pleaſure, as here <hi>A I, N C,</hi> of which <hi>I N,</hi> is the Line of Defence <hi>Secant.</hi> Upon this <hi>C A,</hi> I let fall a Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular-line, touching the extremity of the Face <hi>B K,</hi> in <hi>K,</hi> and I take the Line <hi>F K,</hi> for the Flanque; and thus I do round about the whole Fortification; and this from a Square, to a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of twelve ſides <hi>incluſive.</hi> In ſuch Fortreſſes, as have more than twelve Polygones, I keep always the ſame Courtines. And ſo the form of a Square with its Ground-Lines is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſeen in <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. and the Structure of it ſhewed before. From this alteration ariſe theſe Advantages; Firſt, That the Gorges are lengthened by <hi>F G,</hi> and <hi>H E,</hi> and therefore the Bulworks at their entrance become wider and fitter for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and the uſe of neceſſary Artillery; as may be ſeen in the Profile of the Flanques. But the Gorges remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42528:265"/> at the length of <hi>D G,</hi> the ſaid Artillery cannot be duly Lodged. This lengthening of the Gorges maketh alſo the Flanques <hi>E I, F K,</hi> longer than the former Flanques <hi>K G,</hi> and <hi>I H,</hi> were: This Obliquity of Flanques cauſeth alſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>A I,</hi> and <hi>K B,</hi> together with the Moats lying before them, to be Defended at Right-angles, and that the Lines of Defence <hi>F A,</hi> and <hi>E B,</hi> become ſhorter. And laſtly, This manner of Structure giveth ſufficient room for the Cutting or Retiring of the Flanques. And concerning the Angle-flanqued, or Angle of the Bulwork, which in a Square is 60 degrees; he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to have it greater, let him draw a Line from the Point, where the Flanque and Courtine meet together, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the oppoſite Flanque; as by 5 to <hi>Q,</hi> which is the Line <hi>D</hi> 5 <hi>Q,</hi> and ſo at th'other ſide. Thus the Faces become ſomething ſhorter, and the Angle ſomething greater, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the 21 of the firſt of <hi>Euclid.</hi> But the Second Flanque is loſt, which in a Square ſignifieth but little. And this in my opinion, is ſufficient as to the alteration of the Ground-Lines, and the finding of them; and the more Bulworks in any Figure keep their juſt diſtance, the more conſiderable will be the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage gained by their Alteration.</p>

                     <head>Of the Fauſſe-bray.</head>
                     <p>THe Modern Engineers draw the Fauſſe-bray parallel, round about the foot of the Wall, at ſuch a diſtance, that between the Parapet of the Fauſſe-bray and the Wall is left a hidden way of between 15 and 25 Foot. This Parapet is made to defend the Moat, when the Enemy is paſſed the Counter-ſcarp, and intendeth to carry over the Gallery. I make alſo Fauſſe-brays, but after another manner than the Modern, <hi>viz.</hi> thus: I draw a Parallel-Line with the Flanques, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. <hi>X W,</hi> parallel with the Flanque 6 <hi>V,</hi> at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of five Rods; ſo that the place may be capable to hold Canon; afterwards I lengthen the Faces of the Bulwork, as <hi>B V,</hi> till they cut the parallel <hi>X, W;</hi> this done, I draw a parallel with the Courtine, at the diſtance of 3 or 4 ⓪, as <hi>X Y;</hi> ſo that the Lines <hi>V, W, X, Y,</hi> 2, 3, make the Fauſſe-bray; and this I do round about the Fortreſs, onely before the Flanque and Courtine, and not before the Faces. The reaſons hereof are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42528:265"/> theſe: Firſt, It is found by experience, that the Fauſſe-brays are more hurtful than advantagious before the Faces; becauſe they are not of ſervice, before the Enemy cometh to Lodge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Eſplanade</hi> or Parapet of the hidden way, and then they are to oppoſe him, which they cannot poſſibly do: And this ſo much the leſs, becauſe the Enemy may plant his Canon there for the Deſtroying and Diſmounting of them. Which is eaſily done, ſeeing it is but a bare Parapet, which is ſoon thrown down; ſo that in this part before the Faces, which are Attacqued, no body can remain for Defence, by reaſon of the playing of the great Guns from the Batteries, which may be made as need requireth; as here <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. is intimated by the Letters <hi>A, B,</hi> and <hi>C;</hi> where from the Battery <hi>A,</hi> the Face of the Bulwork <hi>D,</hi> and its Fauſſe-bray is pierced Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and from the Battery <hi>B</hi> Obliquely; but the Battery <hi>C</hi> cutteth and cleareth the Earth away, which is ſhaken by the two others; ſo that by theſe Batteries and Muſquet-ſhots, coming from the Lines and <hi>Cors de Guards,</hi> the Faces, as well of the Fauſſe-bray, as of the great Wall, are ſoon ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and left without Defence, ſo that no body may be ſeen upon theſe Lines without being hit; whence it followeth, That they cannot hinder the coming over of the Gallery, but it muſt of neceſſity be done from the oppoſite Flanque. <hi>Item,</hi> That ſo ſoon as this part of the Fauſſe-bray, lying before the Face, is diſcovered, it is preſently made uſeleſs to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and not onely ſo, but it does them this hurt and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that ſo ſoon as the Gallery cometh over, the Miners are able to Undermine the Faces of the Bulwork, where they pleaſe, and at ſeveral places together. The Mines being blown up, the Enemy may ſet Footing upon the ſpace where the Fauſſe-bray lies, not onely to Aſſault the Breach, but he may run along the Foot of the Wall through the Fauſſe-bray, to fall on at more places at the ſame time. To this it might be repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Fauſſe-bray ought to be Cut with Trenches, to hinder this running about. But every one who has experience in theſe Actions, knows very well, what ſlender Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Trenches are able to make, eſpecially, when the Earth, which is raiſed by the Mine, falls down, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times buries the Defenders alive. This place is alſo of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the Enemy, when the Breach is Retrenched, and he will make new Attacques upon it, and by that means
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42528:266"/> will lodge himſelf conveniently in the Fauſſe-bray, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Breach; whereas otherwiſe, where there is no Fauſſe-bray before the Faces, he findeth very inconvenient Lodging againſt the ſlooping of the Wall, ſeeing no other place is found to fix upon. The Miners are forced to make their Mines about the place, where the Gallery cometh on; beſides that the Faces, which are ſurrounded with theſe Fauſſe-brays, being Attacqued by Canon and Mines, all the Ruines of them remain lying in the ſame, and afford an eaſier Aſcent unto the Enemy; whereas otherwiſe, where they are not, the Ruines rowl down into the Moat, and the Breach remaineth clear, and the Enemy findeth little Earth to Retrench himſelf. By all which it is eaſie to underſtand, That this part bringeth more advantage than hurt unto the Enemy. To what end is it then, to be at ſuch Charges to our Prejudice, and to cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Moat before the Bulworks with this needleſs Parapet? Therefore to conclude, I ſay, That the Faces of a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work being Attacqued, can make little Oppoſition of their own; but ought to be Defended from the Flanques and parts of the Courtine; and the more eaven and neatly the Faces lie, the better may they be Flanqued. That part of the Flanque of the Fauſſe-bray <hi>D,</hi> hinders alſo, that the Face a <hi>G</hi> from being defended at the bottom from the oppoſite Flanque. Some Engineers are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Fauſſe-brays ought to run out after the ſhape of Ravelins in the middle, before the Courtine. I think this needleſs, where the Lines of Defence are of a juſt length, not much exceeding 60 Rods; but where they be longer, this muſt be practiſed. At <hi>Breda,</hi> it is done before ſome long Courtines. And this is enough as to what concerns the Ground-Lines of the Fauſſe-bray, in the <hi>Profiles:</hi> I ſhall ſhew hereafter, how the Work is to be raiſed. It remaineth now, that I ſpeak of the Ground-Lines of the Counter-ſcarp and hidden way, and how it may be made, that it may defend it ſelf with great Advantage, without the great Wall; and that theſe Counter-ſcarps are as ſtrong, yea ſtronger, than the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Fortreſſes themſelves.</p>

                     <p>THe Modern Engineers do ſtrengthen the outward Brink of the Moat (or Counter-ſcarp in <hi>Italian,</hi>) with Ravelins and Half-moons, leaving a hidden way with a Ditch about it, and without this hidden way they make ſometimes another, without a Ditch; as may be ſeen at <hi>Breda:</hi> Which latter I hold to be very good, becauſe not onely great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence may be made from thence, but they are alſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Sallying out, both on Foot and on Horſe-back; for the Moat doth not hinder it, and the Enemy doth not know from what ſide he muſt expect the Sally: Thoſe who thus Sallyout, being driven back, may always retire hither, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in a poſture of Defence again behind this Parapet; whereas otherwiſe they are many times driven into the Ditch of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den way, with great loſs and diſorder. This hidden Way (or <hi>Eſplanade</hi>) coſteth little, for in places where the ground is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dry, it is cut in above half its height under the Horizon, that is, three or four Foot, that it may be the better flanqued from the firſt <hi>Eſplanade</hi> which is behind it; as alſo, that the Shots may flie more Horizontally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do Fortifie my Moat with another kind of Work, and I ſhall ſhew firſt the manner how I do it, and afterwards give reaſons why it is ſo much

About this Work I draw a Parallel-Line at the diſtance of five Rods, <hi>viz.

At the brink of this Ditch I make a hidden way or <hi>Eſplanade,</hi> whoſe ſloping is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to the Wall of the Counter-Guard, without Ditches, with ſmall coſt, which becomes a great benefit. This I continue about the whole Fortreſs; and all is clearly ſeen in the Figure, how the Work muſt lie according to the ſcale and meaſures. Theſe are all the Outworks, which I look upon as neceſſary for a good Defence; and I make no Hornworks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs extream neceſſity do require it, when perhaps there is ſome height; and then I make them after another manner than the Modern, as the nature of the place does require.</p>

                     <p>IT is many times neceſſary to make theſe or the like Works to take in any heights or ſuburbs, according as the place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it.

Yea, in ſuch occaſions the Defence of the great Wall is but troubleſome to theſe or the like Works; for the Muſqueteers of the great Wall, ſhooting by night onely upon the Alarm of the Aſſaulters of the Outworks, do hit as well within as without, and wound as well the Defenders as the Adverſaries.

                     <p>OF theſe Outworks it might be ſaid, That they take in much place, which is a truth; but when we ſhall have ſhewed what benefit cometh by them, I doubt not but that will outweigh any inconvenience that ſhall be occaſioned be the great ſpace and place which theſe Works take in more than other Works uſually do. Neither is the difference ſo very great: For admit, that about the Modern Seven-angled Work <hi>Fig.</hi> 5. <hi>Numb. III.</hi> there ſhould be made another hidden Way about that which is there already, or that it ſhould be ſtrengthened with two hidden ways; the Semi-diameter of my Heptagone <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. is but five Rod longer then that of th'other. In recompence whereof it is to be conſidered, That my exterior Polygones of the Heptagone are 80 Rods; whereas thoſe of th'other (or Modern) Heptagone are but 70 Rod long, which in the whole maketh 70 Rod difference, which is an entire Polygone. Wherefore to include the place of my Heptagone after the Modern manner, there would be required eight Bulworks; ſo that I do include and Fortifie more place with fewer Bulworks than now is uſual, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men will eaſily conceive, by comparing the one with th' other. To ſhew then, what good this Counter-guard doth, let us ſuppoſe, That the Fortreſs <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. is alſo Attacqued by the Approaches <hi>O O.</hi> Now skilful Artiſts know, That it is beſt for the Enemy to Attacque the Point <hi>D,</hi> and after he hath gained the Counter-ſcarp, to paſs the Ditch of the Counter-guards of 5 Rods.

That which hinders, that no greater place is found for the Battery of the Aſſaulters, is the Ravelin <hi>F,</hi> and the Angle of the Flanque of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-guard <hi>I.</hi> Let us ſee, whether there be no where elſe a place to make a Battery, to break the <hi>Retired Flanques</hi> withall, and to Diſmount the Canon ſtanding upon the ſame. Suppoſe there be a Battery by <hi>B,</hi> from thence with the Line <hi>B</hi> one might boar in between the Ravelin <hi>F,</hi> and the Angle <hi>I,</hi> but not ſo, as to touch the loweſt and firſt Flanque; yet this ſhot (which cannot be done by more than one Piece of Canon) would come obliquely againſt the laſt Shooting-hole of the ſecond <hi>Retired Flanque,</hi> and cannot Diſmount the Canon that ſtandeth there, becauſe the ſhot hitteth the Parapet obliquely in the forepart. No more can it be done from the Battery <hi>A,</hi> againſt which Batteries upon the Line <hi>D E,</hi> every where Counter-batteries may be made. Put the caſe, That the Enemy not regarding all theſe difficulties, do with great loſs paſs the Ditch by <hi>D,</hi> and undermine the Point of the Counter-guard, (which would alſo be very hard to do, ſeeing the Walls are made ſo, that one cannot well put a Spade into the Ground without being diſcovered) and make a Breach. In this caſe, I can firſt with ſmall labour cut off this Point by the Retrenchments 1 and 2, till the great Retrenchments by 3 and 4 be finiſh't, which are duly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Flanques 6 and 7, as alſo from the Bulworks-point 8; beſides that they ſuccour and defend one another. And in caſe the Beſiegers mean to paſs between the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards the Bulworks-point, without gaining before the two Lines marked with 3 and 4, they will find hot work. But ſuppoſe they force one of theſe Lines, then there is within, two or three Rods after them, another ready, and thoſe that lie before are Undermined, which Mines are blown up, when the Enemy once thinks to lodge there; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42528:272"/> this is a thing that may be done with great advantage. There needs not one Rod of ground be loſt, but what is gained with abundance of bloud, and alſo with great toile and labour. Being forced, we have alway a free retirement into the Ravelins marked with <hi>K</hi> and <hi>L.</hi> And in caſe there be but men within a Fortification made after my Method, who underſtand the Work, it ſeems impoſſible to gain it any other way, than by length of time, and with the loſs of many men. This Work helpeth it ſelf, nothing being in the way that hindereth; and all parts are ſo contrived, that they are provided againſt all inconveniencies. Hence the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Reader may eaſily conceive, what advantage theſe Outworks have before the Modern. They are Flanqued within and without with Canon and Muſquets from the great Wall; there may be made in haſte, and with ſmall pains, as many Retrenchments as is deſired, which are all enfiled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without from the great Wall; and the more obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are caſt in the way, the more the ſtrength of theſe Works is diſcovered. This is enough as to the form and advantage of my Outworks, which each according to his judgement and place may apply: In my opinion, it would be needleſs to propound theſe things in a plainer manner, ſeeing all particularities may be obſerved by the Figures. It might be ſaid, That theſe Outworks would coſt more, than thoſe that are now in uſe: the contrary of which is true; for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet of the Modern hidden Way having a Baſe of 60 or 70 Foot, coſteth as much as my Counter-guards-wall, whoſe Profile I do make ſo, that it is juſt Canon-proof. I ſhall not add here the charges of the Modern Crownworks, Hornworks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I put my two Ravelins againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Half-moon and Ravelin; the Counter-guard againſt the Counter-ſcarp now in uſe, my outward hidden Way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ditches (which is made with ſmall charges) againſt the Modern ſecond hidden Way, being alſo without Ditches. And although this Work ſhould coſt much more, yet the charge is ſufficiently balanced by the benefit that is had thereby: For the Fortreſſes made after this manner, have quite another Defence, and are, beſides their Out and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, provided againſt all Occurrences, with 2, 3, a 4, double Flanques, made as well for Canon, as for Muſquets. If any body thinketh, that I propound new and ſtrange
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42528:272"/> things, as doubtleſs thoſe will do, who are poſſeſſed with the Modern practice of Fortifying, and never did ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more convenient means, or examine the ſtrength of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of it diſtinctly; or what may be the cauſe, why Strong-Holds are loſt ſo ſoon, neither underſtand the force of the Maxims of War now in uſe: To thoſe I reply, That if they will conſider theſe new things judiciouſly, they will find, that the practices of War now in uſe, ought to be preferred before thoſe old things; and that the Work is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper and capable of making a good Defence; and that theſe things were not practiſed conjecturally in a Cloſet, but in occaſions of Beſieging, or being Beſieged; and that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral countreys and grounds, and in ſuch places where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed flew ſwift Bullets, not Sugar-plums, or roaſted Capons. Many things may be projected upon Paper; but we ought to look, whether they be practicable in the open Fields, The Latin proverb, <hi>Facile eſt inventis addere,</hi> might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here, I do confeſs, but it hath not been done as yet by others. I have been about this a long time; but alway obſerving more and more, whether any thing might hinder it, which perhaps I had not conſidered of; and poſſibly there may be ſome ſuch thing, but whatever it be, it may with eaſe be rectified by time and practice. All things deviſed by men, do not immediately come to perfection. Let them who pleaſe to uſe this way, firſt conſider the Work well; and if there be any thing that they do not like, let them practice the Latin proverb aboveſaid. There are yet many Particularities in this VVork, which I do not deſcribe here, but keep them for my uſe, and propound onely the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. It is true, That the Art of Fortifying is highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in theſe United Provinces, by reaſon of the continual exerciſe in it: But here have been but few alterations or diverſities of Attacques, ſeeing they are almoſt all of them made after the ſame manner; as alſo the Defences of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were furniſhed moſt commonly with ignorant Engineers, and their places ill Fortified; ſo that being Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and much preſſed, they wanted many things that were moſt neceſſary. Here in theſe parts they have been a while at a ſtand, without practiſing any thing at all, which might ſerve to rectifie their Errors; although underſtanding men ſaw well enough, that there was ſomething wanting, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42528:273"/> that the Work did want another Form; and this proceeds chiefly from the impreſſion which many had, and ſtill have, that the Fortifications were at perfection, contrary to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and matter of Fact in the late Wars. In this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they were confirmed by the curious ſearches, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and amendments, made by His Excellency <hi>Prince Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> and His Highneſs <hi>Friderick Henrick,</hi> Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> of glorious Memory: Theſe indeed did in thoſe days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many things exceeding well; but the manner of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing being much altered ſince, the Fortifications ought alſo to be ſtrengthened againſt them. The Practitioners have onely joyned to the firſt Inventions, thoſe things which ſerve to eſtabliſh Fortifications upon ſure Rules, according to the Mathematicks, to which we ought not to be tied too cloſe; however it is neceſſary to take their aſſiſtance in this Science. The queſtion is not, Whether the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do lie exactly according to the Rules of Mathematicks; but whether the Lines be well Flanqued, and all things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for moſt conveniency. I confine my ſelf indeed to theſe Rules and Calculations, for ſo much as the firſt Ground-Lines do require; but upon theſe I make my Obſervations afterwards: ſo that my Work receives no ſmall benefit from thence, by reaſon of the firm and well-contrived Flanques, and the giving of little advantage and place to the Enemy to erect his Batteries againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Many places (though well Fortified) are alſo loſt in a ſhort time, for want of skilfull Officers and Governours. For although a man had the beſt Sword he could wiſh for, and yet did not know how to uſe it for his advantage, the worſt would be as good for him as the beſt. Let the beſt Fortreſs be defended by a Governour, who knows it not, that Fortreſs ſhall be gained ſooner than a mean place Commanded by an experienced Officer. This hath been ſufficiently made good in theſe late Wars, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Hiſtories do teſtifie abundantly. For, Retrenchments, Cuts, Counter-approaches, Counter-mines, beſides the ordering of Sallies at due times; as alſo the managing of Fire-works, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by an expert perſon and skilfull Architect, are all very advantagious for Places, and detain the Enemy long. And yet they cannot well be known, before there is Attacque made; and then they may eaſily be ſo ordered, as to be made
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42528:273"/> more advantagious for the Enemy, then for the Place it ſelf: Hereof there are examples enough, and theſe Works can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a good ſucceſs, unleſs they be directed by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Architect, who has not onely a perfect knowledge in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, but underſtands alſo the power of Artillery and Fire-works, as alſo the manner of managing them, and how Mines ought to be made upon all occaſions. And this I think ſufficient for the deſigning of Ground-lines, and have deſcribed onely three Figures more of three Regular Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones Fortified; ſee <hi>Num. IIII.</hi> one of them, after the <hi>great Royal,</hi> whoſe exterior Polygone is 100 ⓪; another after the <hi>mean Royal,</hi> whoſe exterior Polygone is 90 ⓪; and a third after the <hi>little Royal,</hi> the exterior Polygone being 80 ⓪.</p>

                     <p>I Shall ſay onely this, That it would be too long to ſhew here particularly the manner of working, which I eſteem as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſeeing that Irregular Fortreſſes are made up out of parts of Regular ones: The calculation thereof may be done after the Modern practice, and the parts afterwards reformed according to my way; as hath been ſhewed in the Regular. There are many Engineers, who think it an Art to Fortifie any places altogether Irregular, although they might well enough alter them. I do not glory in this; but am very well content, when I meet with ſuch an unfit Figure, to reform it after the Regular, as near as the place will permit. A Regular place, beſides that it hath its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence more equal, is alſo the fitter, and taketh in with the ſame Lines more ſpace, which I prove thus: Let there be a Right-angled Square, each of whoſe ſides is 12 Rod, and the four together 48 Rod, whoſe content is 144 ſquare Rod: Let there be another Irregular Square or <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo four ſtreight Lines each of 12 Rod, that is, the four of 48 Rod; let this <hi>Rhomboides</hi> be made of two Equilateral Triangles, then the ſhorteſt Diameter is 12 Rod, and the longeſt 20 Rod, and 8 foot, whoſe content is therefore 124 ſquare Rods, and 8 ſquare Feet; From whence it appeareth, That the <hi>Rhomboides</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 19 Rod, and 2 ſquare Feet leſs than the Quadrat; and the more the <hi>Rhomboide</hi> recedeth from Regularity, the leſs is the content of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is true of Irregular Fortifications, That the Rules and Maxims of the Regular being known, the good or bad Form, as alſo the ſtrength or weakneſs dependeth wholly on the knowledge and experience of the Engineers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>I Give this Obliquity to the Flanques for the Reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. See <hi>Numb. II.</hi> the Figure being Calculated and ſtated after the foregoing manner and proportion, or being mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the Fields, the longeſt Defence-line would exceed a Muſquet-ſhot; whereas now the ſaid Line by this Obliquity is brought to its due length; whereby I reap this advantage, that with fewer Bulworks than the Modern do uſe, I can include a far greater ſpace. Examples have been before alledged. And with an <hi>Octogone</hi> of my great Fortification I do include as much place, wanting onely about half a Polygone, as the Modern do with an <hi>Hendecagone,</hi> or Fortreſs of Modern Bulworks; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſo much charge is ſaved, and the Lines of Defence remain within Muſquet-ſhot. <hi>Item,</hi> By this Delineation, the Gorges gain on each ſide in length 8 Rods in an <hi>Hendecagone,</hi> whereby the Bulworks get the deſired opening at their entrance, which maketh place for the Retired Flanques, and affordeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency for the making Retrenchments ſpeedily and eaſily.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42528:277"/> By this Obliquity the Flanques do likewiſe become alſo longer, and therefore fitter to lodge a competent number of Canon and Muſqueteers upon them. This Obliquity cauſeth alſo the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes not to ſtand Obliquely, and that the Moats are Right-angled and defended from the Flanques. And whereas they ſay, that the Perpendicular Flanques defend the Outworks the better, this doth not ſtand to reaſon; but it is known, that the Oblique ones do it better, ſeeing they come more flat againſt them, and the Outworks are better ſeen from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Flanques, when they are made after this manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>THeſe three or four Flanques, I make at the top of one another, not to plant them all full of Canon; but to fit the uppermoſt with Muſqueteers and <hi>Falconets,</hi> as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requireth. But if need ſhould require, that I muſt have a ſtrong Counter-Battery upon the Flanques, or that much Canon muſt be there, to hinder the coming over of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries: then put the caſe, that all four Flanques are fill'd with Canon; what ſhould hinder me from uſing them at pleaſure, without endamaging the lower, or giving fire to the lower Canon before the due time, if I go to work af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner following? At one ſide of theſe Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Flanques, I place a skilful perſon, either an Officer of the Artillery, or ſome other. This Officer, when they are upon Diſcharging, commandeth the men in the lower Flanques, to retire themſelves at the ſide of the Battery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Way, by which the Canon is let into the Flanques,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42528:278"/> till ſuch time as the uppermoſt have Diſcharged; which Shooting beginneth from the laſt Retired Flanque, where the longeſt and heavieſt Canon may moſt conveniently be uſed. When theſe have Diſcharged, they Charge preſently again, and then thoſe of the ſecond Retired Flanque give Fire; which being done, they alſo Charge again with all poſſible expedition: For thoſe that have Diſcharged (beginning from the hindermoſt) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prejudiced by the following <hi>Canonadoes;</hi> and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth, till the Flanque of the Fauſſe-brays (being the laſt to give Fire) hath alſo done. In this time the hindermoſt can have almoſt Charged and Levelled; ſo that after this manner one may orderly Charge and Diſcharge the Canon, as if it were a Band of Muſqueteers, without hindering or prejudicing another. Theſe Canon-ſhots are alternatively fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Muſquet-ſhots, coming from the ſecond Flanques; (where I would Lodge no Canon, except there were great need, for the reaſons before mentioned) as alſo from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Flanque of the Fauſſe-bray, and alſo from the half of the great Walls Flanque and Faces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concerning what is objected, That the lower Canon might be kindled by the upper before its time; for this, no other remedy needs to be uſed, but to cover the Holes with a Plate of Lead, as they do in Ships. Now it may be conſidered, Whether it be eaſie or no, to bring a Gallery over a Moat, that is ſeconded by ſuch a Hail of Canon and Muſquet-ſhot.</p>

                     <p>SInce here is mention of ſo many Canons, there muſt be great number of them, to furniſh one of theſe Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with Artillery: For beſides that the great Wall (or Royal Work) requireth much Canon, the Outwork ought to have part of it too, ſeeing it defendeth it ſelf, as well as the great Work, with Artillery and Muſquets; and according to the number of Gun-holes, there muſt upon the four heightned Flanques on each ſide of every Bulwork be at leaſt 20 Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is 40 Pieces for each Bulwork; which in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of ſeven Bulworks amounts to 208 Pieces, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Fortreſs onely. Now in the Outworks there is by the joyning Half-moons of the Counter-guard, on each ſide place for 12, 13, or 14 Pieces: If it be 14, it is for every Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42528:278"/> 28, which for the Counter-guard of an Heptagone comes to 196 Pieces of Artillery, and ſo the whole Work to 476; to which Ammunition being added proportionally, all other things neceſſary, the charge would be extraordinary.</p>
                     <div type="answer">
                        <head>Anſwer.</head>
                        <p>IN this my Fortification I want no more, or at leaſt very few more Canon, than in the Modern; which I prove thus: In a Modern Heptagone there muſt be at leaſt eight Pieces for every Bulwork, when a Siege is expected; namely 3 upon every Flanque, and two upon the Bulworks Point, that is 4 Demy-Canons, two <hi>Pelicans</hi> ſhooting a Bullet from 3 to 8 pound, and two half or whole <hi>Dragons</hi> as occaſion requireth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are commonly joyned 4 or 6 whole Canon, to be uſed upon Counter-Batteries; theſe being reckoned together make up 56. It is an old cuſtome, to keep in Fortreſſes that are conſiderable, twice as many Pieces in the Arſenal, as are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wall, to fill up the places of thoſe that ſhall happen to be Diſmounted or to crack, or to become uſeleſs by any other accident; as alſo to be uſed upon the Crown, and Hornworks: This number is in all 188; which the Modern Engineers appoint in their Works. Theſe I diſtribute in my Fortification, when there is no Siege, after this manner: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every middle Flanque of the great Wall two, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Bulworks-point two, which is 6 for every Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and ſo for the Royal Work 42: In the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard none are required, but however, in caſe one would Plant them there, there might be ſet near every joyning Half-moon, two, which maketh 4 for every Courtine, that is 28 for ſeven Courtines, in all 70 Pieces; and then the place is furniſhed round about with Artillery, as well for the Inworks as Outworks. But inſtead of lodging theſe 28 Pieces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Flanques of the Counter-guards, I think it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to uſe them upon the next Ravelin, becauſe I keep there the outward Centries, or <hi>Cors de Guards,</hi> which do Flanque the Counter-guards from within, and hit the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from behind, in caſe he ſhould undertake to paſs the great Moat. But in time of Siege, I diſtribute my Canon quite otherwiſe, and do as follows. At the firſt coming on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42528:279"/> or ſurrounding, I take my lighteſt Canon and place them upon the points of the Counter-guards, to keep off the Enemies Quarters, as far as it is poſſible; yet, the Quarters being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and I perceiving whereabout they open their Approaches, whether they bring on 2 or 3, although they make ſeldom more than two, and have ſometimes a third, onely for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions ſake: Admit, they carry on two Approaches, by which they intend to Attacque two Bulworks; to promote theſe Approaches, it is needful for the Beſiegers to raiſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, under whoſe favour they may make their Labourers work with more ſurety. Againſt theſe Batteries I raiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-batteries (that is, when they come near, within 150 or 200 Rod,) theſe Counter-batteries I can raiſe every where, as well in the outmoſt Ravelin before the Counter-guard, as upon the Faces of the Counter-guards themſelves, whereto I uſe ſome heavy Pieces: upon the other Bulworks or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works there is then little need of any Pieces, but onely of <hi>Falconets,</hi> or other ſmall Guns. Now the Beſiegers being after all difficulties, come ſo far with their Approaches, that they are ready to paſs the Ditch of the Counter-guards, then I uſe no where any Pieces more to defend the Outworks, but onely upon the Flanques of the Counter-guards, where in Fortreſſes according to the <hi>great Royal,</hi> might be uſed 14. Yet in caſe two Bulworks be Attacqued at once, the Ditches and Faces may alſo be defended by two oppoſite Flanques, upon which two there muſt then be 28 Pieces. If three Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works be Attacqued, there muſt be 42. Theſe Pieces I can always retire again from the Flanques into the joyning Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin, and from thence into the Fauſſe-bray of the great Wall, and further upon the Flanques of the great Wall, which are oppoſite to the Faces Attacqued; and upon all occaſions there need be no more upon theſe Flanques than 14, ſeeing the Enemy cannot place any more againſt them with advantage, but 10, unleſs they come to ſtand one in anothers way. Suppoſe one would have 18 upon every Shoulder or Flanque, this would make 54 Canons for three Flanques, which being alſo trebled, the whole number amounts to 162. Whence it appeareth, That in my Fortification no more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is required than in the Modern; and one might in time of need very well make ſhift with a third part, that is with 54, in a Fortreſs of ſeven Bulworks, if a skilful Governour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42528:279"/> had the management of it: But for want of ſuch men, the beſt Strong-Holds are ſoon loſt; For let a place be Fortified with as much providence as it will, in caſe he who Commands it, has no skill, it ſignifieth nothing.</p>

                        <p>THis Work being well conſidered, it will be found, that the charges differ little from the Modern: For I with my Pentagone take in as much or more place than the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern with an Hexagone; my Line of Defence <hi>Fichante</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill within Muſquet-ſhot, whereby the charges of one whole Courtine and a Bulwork in a Pentagone are ſaved. Concerning the charges of the retired Flanques, againſt them I put the two Faces of the Modern Fauſſe-brays, which I do not make; as alſo the charges that are required for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Moat before the Courtine, where in my Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation out of that part of the Moat nothing near ſo much Earth is taken.</p>

                        <p>It is not neceſſary, that theſe Flanques ſhould be brought preſently into this order round about the Fortreſs, when they are made. One may make up the firſt paved Flanque of the great Wall, which falleth upon the Ground-line, ſomething higher then uſually, and lay 2 or 3 Benches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42528:280"/> the Parapet, and putting Paliſadoes at the top of the Parapet, which come to be ſo high as the great Wall; and being Beſieged, whilſt the Outworks are diſputed, there is time enough to bring all things into order.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the great compaſs of the Counter-guards, the charges beſtowed that way are little, ſeeing in time of Peace, (as is ſaid before,) the incloſed Land and Wall, and all may ſerve for civil uſes as well, as if theſe Walls were not there at all: Beſides, that theſe being compared with the Modern Outworks, as Half-moons, Horn and Crown-works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are about many Strong-Holds, it will be found, that theſe my Counter-guards do not incloſe ſo much place, nor do not coſt ſo much. It might be further ſaid, that theſe my Fortreſſes would require more men for Defence than the Modern: In order whereunto, it is to be conſidered, How the Garriſons ought to be ordered in time of an Attacque? I ſhall onely anſwer this, That the Outworks ought firſt to be Defended well; and to do that well in my Fortifications, no more men are required, than in one of the Modern, having but one Bulwork more than one of mine; for by my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, I include more place with fewer Bulworks. I ſhall onely tender this, That the Flanques being well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Fronts are eaſily defended; for herein conſiſteth the ſtrength of Fortreſſes: which may be compared with a man that hath ſtrong and long arms; it is evident, that ſuch a one can better defend himſelf, than another who hath ſhort and ſtiff arms. Thus I conclude this little Work, hoping that it will be acceptable to the Lovers; and ſtir them up, in caſe it do not pleaſe them, to bring to light ſomething better.</p>

This manner may be alſo proved by Arithmetick.</p>

                              <p>I deſire the Square of 9738; That is, of 9700 and 38. (For ſo every Side in this Table is parted into two Portions.) A Column bearing 97.. on the head of it, is found only in this 28. Page, and another in the 29. In the Margin of this 28. pag. I find 38. A right Line running from this 38, croſſeth the column marked 97.. at the number 94828644. This 94828644 is the Square of 9738.</p>
                              <p>But the Square of 9756 is not found in this pag. becauſe 56 is more than 49. In the margin of pag. 29, I find 56. A right line, running from this 56, ſheweth you the number 95179536, in the column on whofe top ſtands 97.. This 95179536 is the Square of 9756.</p>
                              <p>Thus in p. 24, you ſee 67551961 in the right Line running from the Marg. 19, to the column whoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical is 82.. Then ſay, 67551961 is the Square of 8219. And ſo I find 70829056 to be the Square of 8416. In pag. 9. you have 7080921 the Square of 2661. And in pag. 2, you have 675684 the Square of 822. As in pag. 3, you find 70756 the Square of 266.</p>
                              <p>That <hi>Firſt opening,</hi> in Pag. 2. &amp; Pag. 3, contains <hi>all Square Numbers leſs than a Million,</hi> and <hi>all Sides leſs than</hi> 1000. And the <hi>firſt Column</hi> of thoſe two Pages [2 and 3] hath the Square of every Number leſs than 100; That is to ſay, It hath all ſquare numbers leſs than 10000. Wherfore the <hi>Square</hi> number 62821476 being <hi>given,</hi> and its <hi>Side</hi> being <hi>ſought,</hi> you may cut off the two laſt Figures [76] and may find all the reſt of the Figures in that <hi>Firſt Opening;</hi> thus,</p>
